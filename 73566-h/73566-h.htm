<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> articles embodied with other matter in this book,
were intended as a broad survey of the principles and
details of modern aeroplane construction, concerning
which there is a noticeable deficit amongst existing
aeronautical literature.</p>

<p>They were written at a time when specific references
to modern British aircraft were forbidden, and although
from a comparative point of view this is to be regretted,
the details and methods dealt with are, in the author’s
opinion, representative of those most generally used in
machines of present-day design. It is hoped that the
book will appeal not only to those engaged on the
manufacture, but also to those concerned with the uses
of aircraft.</p>

<span class="subhead">INTRODUCTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> purpose of this book is to give some indication of the
principles and methods of construction of modern aeroplanes,
as distinct from those considerations pertaining purely to
design, although occasional references to various elementary
principles of aerodynamics have been found necessary to
illustrate the why and wherefore of certain constructional
details.</p>

<p>To many the aeroplane is a structure of appalling flimsiness,
yet the principle which it exemplifies, that of obtaining
the maximum strength for a minimum of weight, constitutes
a problem of which the solving is not only an unceasing
labour, but one demanding the observance of the best engineering
procedure. The whole future of aviation, commercially
or otherwise, may be said to be indissolubly bound up
with the development of efficiency; and whether this is to be
attained in improvements in aerodynamical qualities, by the
discovery of a material giving a greatly enhanced strength to
weight ratio, or by progress in the arrangement of the various
members of the complete structure of the aeroplane, is a
matter upon which some diversity of opinion exists. However,
it is certain that the very great developments of the last
few years are due more to refinements in design rather than
construction; and it is questionable whether the constructional
work of the modern aeroplane has developed equally
with design, so that, even taking for granted the oft-repeated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
but very doubtful, statement that we are approaching the
limitations of design, there is certainly plenty of scope for
experiment and improvement in the constructional principles
of the modern aeroplane.</p>

<h3>Standardization of Details.</h3>

<p>Whatever may be said for the standardization of aeroplane
types, a scheme which should effect a considerable saving in
labour and material, and which offers chances of success,
would consist in the standardization of metal fittings and
wood components generally, for in this direction there is certainly
great need for improvement. Taking as a hypothesis
the various makes of scouting machines, we find hardly any
two details the same. This means that if in this country
there are six firms producing machines of their own design
(these figures, of course, being purely suppositionary), there
will be six sets of detail drawings, six sets of jigs, templates,
and press tools, and sundry special machine tools. There
seems no valid reason why many of the fittings for all
machines within certain dimensions should not be of standard
design, and a brief review of the various details which could
be standardized without detracting in the least from aerodynamical
efficiency will indicate the extent to which the conserving
of labour could be carried. In the construction of the
fuselage, the clips fastening the longerons and cross struts
could easily be of one design, whatever the make of the
machine. At present we find some clips are bent up from a
stamping and attached to the longeron without the drilling
of the latter; some built up from various parts, such as
washer-plates, duralumin pressings, and bolted through the
longeron; while some combine advantages and others the
disadvantages of both. In some cases the longerons of spruce
are spindled out for lightening; in others no spindling occurs;
while in a few instances hickory or ash, with or without
channelling, is used. There are the interplane strut attachments,
stern-post fittings, control-surface hinges, and undercarriage
attachments, all showing great variations, and in all
of which the design could be brought within reasonable limits.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
As indicating how unnecessary a good deal of the variation is,
one may instance the fact that for the swaged streamline, or
R.A.F. wires, there are at least three different terminals in
use. Although more difficult of achievement, there is scope
for improvement in the different arrangements for the fixed
gun mounting, while a standard instrument board would
benefit the pilot.</p>

<h3>Methods of Manufacture.</h3>

<p>It is fairly well known that the output of some firms is
considerably better than others, although the machines are of
the same design. Although a good many factors may contribute
to this result, it seems fairly certain that in some
cases the methods of manufacture must be superior, which
calls for some system of standardizing the broad principles
pertaining to manufacturing procedure. Under this arrangement
a much better estimate of probable output could be
made. It is also necessary by the fact that some firms have
been developed through the exigencies of war, and not as a
result of any great manufacturing ability, whereas in peace
time the spur of competition would force the adoption of the
most rapid methods of production. The creation of a central
or universal office for the design of the various jigs used in
the manufacture of aircraft, with power to decide the process
of manufacture, although a somewhat far-reaching reform,
would certainly eliminate a number of useless experiments
made by the individual constructors, and would also greatly
improve the interchangeability of the various components.
In addition, fresh firms to the aviation industry would be at
once acquainted with the general methods of manufacture,
which should be of considerable assistance in expediting
initial output. Of course, this system would tend rather to
destroy individual initiative, in that much that is now left to
the skill and experience of the workman would be predetermined,
although this would be more than compensated for by
the increased benefits accruing to the State. Jigs designed to
produce the same work in different works often differ in
detail considerably, and this, of course, often influences the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
rate of production. As an instance, in some works elaborate
benches are considered necessary for the erection of fuselages,
while in others a pair of trestles suffices. With this system
of unified manufacturing procedure extreme regard would
have to be paid, in the design of various jigs and fixtures, to
adaptability for modifications in design. Otherwise the
various alterations which are bound to occur would result in
an unnecessary expenditure on fresh jigs. It is somewhat
unfortunate that in the general design of an aeroplane, in
numerous cases, far too little regard is paid to considerations
of ease of manufacture, and this is frequently responsible for
the many changes in design after a contract has been started.
Under an ideal system of standardization, the requirements of
manufacture would necessitate consideration in the design of
the constructional details.</p>

<h3>Metal Construction.</h3>

<p>The question of the aircraft materials of the future is not
so much a problem as a matter of gradual evolution. In view
of the dwindling supplies of suitable timber, it certainly seems
more than probable that some form of metal construction will
one day constitute the structure of the aeroplane. The manufacture
of the various components in wood does not necessitate
an extensive plant, the labour necessary is comparatively
cheap and easily available, and moreover the transitory nature
of the whole business, and the ease with which essential
changes in type can be made without the wholesale scrapping
of the expensive jigs associated with the use of steel, all
strengthen the case in favour of wood. The conclusion of
hostilities would introduce another state of affairs, and it is
conceivable that the various types will then be standardized
for different purposes, which may necessitate the greater use
of steel. Certainly the advantage of steel would be better
realized under some system of standardized design, but this
unfortunately is not possible while present conditions obtain.
The advantages of metal as a material considered briefly, are
that it permits of design to close limits without the allowance
of so-called factors of safety, which are now necessary through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
the great variation in the strengths of wood, manufacturing
procedure would be expedited, while one can reasonably expect
a greater degree of precision in the finished machine, due
largely to the increased facilities for accurate manufacture of
components which metal affords. It is quite possible, of course,
given a uniform grade of steel, to design to extremely close
limits without fear of collapse; but the human factor in the
shape of fitter, welder, or operator introduces the unknown
element, and one for which some allowance must always be
made. One cannot assert that any very decided indication
exists of a trend in modern design towards metal construction,
and it is quite possible that this will not arrive until it is
rendered imperative by reason of the scarcity of timber. The
precise composition of the metal is rather a controversial
matter, some authorities favouring steel, and others some
alloy of aluminium, such as, for instance, “duralumin.” The
production of a suitable alloy constitutes a real problem and
one upon which the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics have
already made investigations and experiments. A disadvantage
with steel is that, although it is quite possible to produce, say,
a fuselage entirely of this material to withstand easily the
greatest stress encountered in flying, such a structure, owing
to the thin nature of the various components, would suffer
damage through shocks induced by rolling over rough ground,
and also by handling. In addition the effects of crystallization
would require some considerable study. These and other
reasons indicate that an alloy of aluminium, which for a given
weight would be considerably more rigid than steel, offers
possibilities as a material. It might prove advantageous to
combine both metals, using steel for the more highly stressed
parts, such as, for instance, wing spar attachments, interplane
bracing lugs, and indeed any part where the load to be carried
is one induced by tension.</p>

<p>The foregoing is indicative of some of the more important
directions in which improvement and development are possible,
and certainly ample scope yet exists for the attention of the
student, or indeed any one interested in the future of the
aviation industry.</p>

<span class="subhead">MATERIALS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Seeing</span> that wood constitutes the material for the greater part
of the structure of the aeroplane, that is with very few exceptions,
some notes on the characteristics and qualities of those
woods most commonly used may prove of interest. The choice
of a suitable wood for aircraft construction is a matter of
some difficulty, engendered by the variety of considerations of
which at least some observance is essential. The fundamental
principle of aircraft construction, that of obtaining the maximum
strength for a minimum of weight, affords one standpoint
from which a particular wood may be regarded, but this does
not constitute in itself a sufficient reason for its choice. Of
almost equal importance are such considerations as the length
and size of the balks obtainable from the log, the total stock
available, the relative straightness of grain and freedom from
knots as well as the durability of the wood.</p>

<h3>Variable Qualities of Wood.</h3>

<p>The choice is additionally complicated by the very great
variation found in the strength and characteristics of trees of
exactly the same species, and also of different portions cut from
the same tree. The nature of the site upon which a tree is
grown exercises a marked influence upon its properties, while
as a general rule, it may be taken that the greater number of
annual growth rings per inch, the greater the strength. It is
also a general rule that up to certain diameters, the timber
contained in that part of the tree the greatest distance from
the pith, or centre, is the stronger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>The wood obtained from the base of a tree is heavier than
that at the top, and one finds the influence of this in the
necessity for balancing and alternating the different laminæ of
air-screws before gluing.</p>

<h3>Shrinkage.</h3>

<p>Another point, and one which is intimately concerned with
the proper seasoning of timber, is the amount of moisture
contained in a specimen, and this latter point is of some considerable
importance, as not only is a large amount of moisture
detrimental to the strength values of the timber, but it also
renders useless any attempt at precision of workmanship. It
is this very point of shrinkage, which constitutes the greatest
bar to the achievement of a measure of component standardization,
and it is also one of the most serious disabilities of
wood as a material for aircraft construction. It is now
necessary in the production of finished parts to make some
allowance for resultant shrinkage, which is a matter of guesswork,
and only practicable where some time will elapse
between the finishing of the part and its erection in the
complete machine. Under present conditions, more often
than not the parts are assembled almost immediately they
are made, which means that no allowance over the actual size
is possible, this being due to the various fittings which in
the majority of machines are of set dimensions and clip or
surround the material.</p>

<p>As a natural sequence shrinkage occurs subsequent to the
attachment of the fitting, followed by looseness and loss of
alignment in the structure. Until the proper period for
seasoning can elapse, between the cutting of the tree and its
conversion into aeroplane parts, it is difficult to see how this
disability can be obviated, although latterly some considerable
advances have been made with artificial methods of seasoning.
The prejudice against kiln drying is founded on the belief
that the strength of the timber is reduced, and that extraneous
defects are induced. A method which is a distinct improvement
on those systems, using superheated steam and hot air,
is now being used with apparently good results. In this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
system, steam under very low compression is constantly circulated
through the timber, drying being effected by a gradual
reduction in the humidity of the atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Unreliability of Tabulated Tests.</h3>

<p>The various tables which exist indicating the strength,
weight, and characteristics of various woods are of very doubtful
utility, in some cases fallacious, and in nearly all cases far
too specific. The foregoing enumeration of some of the variations
existing with wood will indicate the enormous difficulty
of obtaining with any exactitude a result representative of the
species of wood tested, and which could be regarded as reliable
data for the calculation of stresses, or for general design.
The moisture content of timber, an extremely variable
quantity, greatly affects the figures relating to the strength
and weight of timber, so that tables indicating the properties
of woods should include the percentage of moisture contained
in the examples tested. Again, certain woods possessing
relatively high strength values, are frequently short-grained
and brittle, and therefore not so suitable as other woods of
lower strength values, but of greater elasticity and resiliency.</p>

<h3 class="center"><span class="smcap">Woods in Use.</span></h3>

<h3>Silver Spruce.</h3>

<p>The wood most extensively used for the main items of
construction is silver spruce, or Sitka spruce, found in great
quantities in British Columbia. Experience has proved this
wood pre-eminently suitable for aeroplane construction, its
strength-weight ratio is particularly good, it can be (at least
until recently) obtained in long lengths up to 30 ft., and,
moreover, is particularly straight grained and free from knots
and other defects. There are other woods possessing higher
strength qualities, but in most cases their value is greatly
diminished by reason of the greater weight, and that only a
limited portion straight of grain and free from knots is obtainable.
The weight of Sitka spruce varies from 26 to 33 lbs.
per cubic foot, and although it is difficult to give a precise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
figure, a good average specimen fairly dry would weigh about
28 lbs. per cubic foot. Some impression of the extent to
which it enters into the construction of the aeroplane will be
gathered if the components usually of spruce are detailed.
For the main spars of the planes spruce is almost universally
used, as here great strength for the least weight is of extreme
importance, while a consideration almost as important is the
necessity of a good average length, straight grained and free
from defects. It is also used for the webs and flanges of the
wing ribs, the leading and trailing edges and wing structure
generally. The longerons or rails of the fuselage of many
machines are spruce, although in this instance ash and
hickory are used to a moderate extent. The growing practice
is to make the front portion of the fuselage of ash, as this is
subject to the greater stress, while the tail portion is of
spruce; but in a number of cases the latter material is used
throughout. The cross struts of the fuselage are invariably
of spruce, as well as such items as interplane and undercarriage
struts and streamline fairings.</p>

<h3>Virginia Spruce.</h3>

<p>This is of a lower weight per cubic foot than Sitka spruce,
but does not possess such a good strength value, cannot be
obtained in such large pieces, and is generally subject to
small knots, which limit the straight-grained lengths
procurable.</p>

<p>It is distinguishable from Sitka spruce by its whiteness of
colour and general closeness of grain.</p>

<h3>Norwegian Spruce.</h3>

<p>This wood is also known as spruce fir and white deal, and
is grown principally in North Europe. Selected balks can
be obtained to weigh no more than 30 lbs. per cubic foot,
which compares very favourably with silver spruce. It can be
obtained in average lengths, but it is subject to the presence
of small hard knots and streaks of resin, although the writer
has seen consignments with very few knots. A material
known as Baltic yellow deal and Northern pine is procured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
from the same source, and is more durable than Norwegian
spruce. It is inclined to brittleness when dry, and is heavier
than white deal, weighing about 36 lbs. per cubic foot. The
recent shortage of silver spruce has led to the employment of
Norwegian spruce for items such as fuselage struts, hollow
fairings to tubular struts, the webs and flanges of the plane
ribs, and generally for those components for which long
straight-grained lengths are not absolutely essential.</p>

<p>For fuselage struts, where the chief consideration is stiffness,
to resist the bending strain produced by inequalities of
wiring, fittings, etc., it may actually give better results, being
slightly more rigid than silver spruce—at least that is the
writer’s experience of it. In addition, very little increase in
weight would result, as this wood can be obtained of almost
the same weight per cubic foot as silver spruce. The defect
usually met with in this wood, of knots occurring at intervals,
would be of no great detriment, the lengths needed for the
fuselage struts being approximately 3 feet and less, and it
would therefore be easily possible to procure wood of this
length free from knots. The other items enumerated are of
varying lengths, which, with care in selection and conversion,
could be arranged for. The practical application of this
would be the increased amount of silver spruce available for
such highly stressed items as wing spars, interplane struts,
and longerons.</p>

<h3>Ash.</h3>

<p>This wood is one of the most valuable of those employed,
being extremely tough and resilient. There are two varieties
in use, English and American, the former being considered
the better material. It is used mainly for longerons, undercarriage
struts, and for all kinds of bent work. It possesses
the quality of being readily steamed to comparatively sharp
curves, and will retain the bend for a considerable period.
The strength and characteristics of ash vary greatly with the
climate under which it is grown, and it is also much heavier
than spruce, the weight per cubic foot ranging between 40
and 50 lbs. Difficulty is also experienced in obtaining lengths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
greater than 20 ft., and even in lengths up to that figure,
continuity of grain is somewhat rare. It is notable that on
various German machines, ash in conjunction with a species
of mahogany is used for the laminæ of the air-screw.</p>

<h3>Hickory.</h3>

<p>Hickory, a species of walnut, is imported from New Zealand
and America, and possesses characteristics similar to those of
ash. It is obtainable in about the same lengths as ash, but in
the writer’s experience is of greater weight. Its chief property
is extreme resiliency, which makes it especially suitable for
skids, and it has also been used to a limited extent for
longerons. It is subject to excessive warping in drying, is
not so durable as ash, and the great difficulty experienced in
obtaining straight-grained lengths is responsible for its waning
popularity.</p>

<h3>Walnut.</h3>

<p>This wood is almost entirely devoted to the making of air-screws,
although the dwindling supplies and the very short
lengths obtainable has practically enforced the employment of
other woods for this purpose.</p>

<h3>Mahogany.</h3>

<p>The term “mahogany” covers an infinite variety of
woods, possessing widely different characteristics, many of the
species being quite unsuitable for the requirements of aircraft
work. That known as Honduras mahogany possesses the best
strength values, is of medium weight, about 35 lbs. per cubic
foot, and is in general use for airs-crews and seaplane floats.
It has been used on some German machines for such parts
as rib webs, but is not really suitable for parts of comparatively
small section, such as longerons, as it is inclined to
brittleness. It is of particular value for seaplane floats and
the hulls of the flying-boat type of machine, as it is not
affected by water. A defect peculiar to Honduras mahogany
is the occurrence of irregular fractures across the grain known
as thunder shakes. Although other so-called mahoganies are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
similar in appearance to the Honduras variety, a species quite
distinct in appearance is that known as Cuban or Spanish
mahogany, which is of darker colour, and much heavier in
weight, averaging about 50 lbs. per cubic foot, which latter
factor almost precludes its use for aeroplane construction.</p>

<h3>Birch.</h3>

<p>One finds very few instances of the use of this wood for
aeroplane details, although it is used fairly extensively in
America for air-screw construction, for which it is only
moderately suited. It possesses a high value of compressive
strength across the grain, but is much affected by climatic
changes, and does not take glue well. It is useful for bent
work, and might conceivably be used instead of ash for small
bent work details. Its weight is about 44 lbs. per cubic foot.</p>

<h3>Poplar.</h3>

<p>Under this name is included such woods as American
whitewood, cotton wood, bass wood, etc. The wood sold under
one or other of these names is generally very soft and brittle,
and although of a light nature, weighing about 30 lbs. per
cubic foot and less, it is of very little utility for the work under
discussion. It has been used for minor parts such as rib webs,
and fairings to tubular struts.</p>

<h3>Oregon Pine.</h3>

<p>The scarcity of silver spruce has led to the adoption of the
wood known as Oregon pine for most of the components for
which the former wood has hitherto been used. The term
“Oregon pine” is applied to the Douglas fir, one of the largest
of the fir species, a length of 200 ft. being an average. It is
altogether heavier than silver spruce, weighing about 34 lbs.
per cubic foot, and also differs greatly in appearance, possessing
a reddish-brown grain, with very distinct annual rings. Its
strength to weight ratios are practically equal to those of silver
spruce, although in the writer’s experience it has a tendency
towards brittleness, and is not so suitable as Sitka spruce for
components of small scantling. With some specimens of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
wood it is noticeable that the effect of drying on freshly sawn
lengths for longerons, etc., is the appearance of “shakes” or
cracks, not previously discernible. Its appearance generally
is reminiscent of pitch pine, for which wood it is sometimes
substituted in connection with building.</p>

<h3>Other Woods.</h3>

<p>The foregoing constitute woods which are in fairly general
use for one purpose or another, there being, of course, very
many other varieties, some of which may be called into use
with the progress of the industry. Of the conifer species, silver
spruce is easily the most suitable timber for aeroplane construction,
and one realizes this more as the various substitutes
are tried. As an instance, cypress is straight of grain with
no very great increase over the weight of spruce, being also
well up the table of strengths. It is, however, much too brittle
for the various members of small section of which an aeroplane
is composed, and does not seem to have any extensive future
for aircraft work. Another, at one time much-advertised
wood, is Parang, a species of mahogany. It has been reputed
to bend well, but it certainly does not enter into the construction
of modern aeroplanes. A consignment handled by
the writer some years ago and intended for bending, was found
to be exceedingly brittle, and although standing a good load,
fractured almost square across the grain, in a manner known
colloquially in the workshop as “carrot-like.” The latter term
is indicative of a characteristic which precludes the use of
many woods possessing other physical properties especially
suitable for aircraft work.</p>

<h3>Multi-ply Wood.</h3>

<p>This term is applied to the sheets of wood composed of a
number of thin layers glued together with the grain reversed.
As the layers are obtained by rotating the tree against cutters
in such a manner that a continuous cut is taken from the
outside almost to the centre, it is possible to get very great
widths, which makes it particularly suitable for aircraft work.
It is made in varying widths up to 4 ft., and in thickness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
from 1/20 in. up to ½ in., consisting of three, five, and seven
layers, although the three-ply variety in thicknesses up to 3/16 in.
is more commonly used. It is made up in nearly all woods,
but those mostly utilized in the aeroplane industry are birch,
ash, poplar, and satin-walnut, birch being superior by reason
of its closeness of grain. Ash ply-wood in some instances
tends towards brittleness, while poplar, although exceptionally
light, is very soft and only used for minor parts. Satin-walnut
is very even in quality but is apt to warp.</p>

<h3>Defects in Timber.</h3>

<p class="clear">Perhaps the most common and prolific defect encountered
with the use of timber is the presence of cracks or shakes of
different character, which are due to different causes. <a href="#i_fig1">Fig. 1</a>
indicates a very common form, known as a “heart shake,”
dividing the timber at the centre; while <a href="#i_fig2">Fig. 2</a>, a “star
shake,” is really a number of heart shakes diverging from the
centre. The process of seasoning sometimes results in the
separation of the annual rings, forming cup shakes, as shown
in <a href="#i_fig3">Fig. 3</a>. It should be understood that the presence of
shakes may render useless an otherwise perfect specimen
of timber, as it frequently happens that in the conversion of
timber so affected the usable portions do not permit of the
sizes necessary for such items as wing spars and struts. The</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>—Twisted grain.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="in0">defect of twisted grain (<a href="#i_fig4">Fig. 4</a>) is often found in ash, and is
caused by the action of the wind when the tree is growing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
and renders such wood of limited utility. Shrinkage affects
all timber in varying degrees, and its effect on boards due
to their position in the log is shown by <a href="#i_fig5">Fig. 5</a>, while
<a href="#i_fig6">Fig. 6</a> indicates the effect of drying on a squared-up section.
Incidentally one may point out that the annual rings, viewed
from the end of the section, should be as straight as possible,
which would obviate to an extent the distortion due to drying
in a component subsequent to its finishing. Another defect,
and one somewhat difficult to detect, is the presence of a
brownish speckled tint in the grain. Any evidence of this in
a specimen indicates the beginning of decay, and is caused by
insufficient seasoning and lengthy exposure in a stagnant
situation.</p>

<h3>Steel.</h3>

<p>The greater proportion of the various fittings employed in
the construction of the aeroplane are built up from sheet
nickel steel, usually of a low tensile strength, to permit of
working in a cold state, as, with a higher grade steel, the
process of bending to template by hand, in many cases a none
too careful procedure, would result in a considerable weakening
of the material at the bend. In addition, the operation of
welding, which now enters into the construction of a number
of fittings, also necessitates a moderate grade of steel. A
higher class of sheet steel, from 35 to 50 tons tensile, is used
for parts subject to stress, such as interplane strut-fittings,
wiring-lugs, etc. As a higher grade of steel is better from a
strength-for-weight point of view, its employment for bent-up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
clips is desirable, although where such a steel is used it is
almost necessary, if the original strength of the material is to
be retained in the finished fitting, to effect the various bends
in a machine, in conjunction with bending jigs. Careful
heat-treatment after bending to shape is an important factor
in removing the stresses set up by working, and in rendering
the structure of the material more uniform.</p>

<h3>Steel Tube.</h3>

<p>Steel, in the form of tubing of various sections, enters
largely into aeroplane construction, and may be said to contribute
largely to the efficiency of the structure. It is now
being used for the different items of the undercarriage, for
struts in the fuselage, interplane struts, and in many cases
control surfaces, such as the ailerons, elevators, and rudder,
are being built of this material entirely. In the early days of
aviation steel tubing attained some considerable popularity,
many machines being built almost entirely of tubing; but
difficulties in its manipulation, and the fact that very often the
methods of attachment reduced its strength considerably,
gradually led to the general employment of wood. The great
advances lately made in the production of a high-grade nickel-chrome
steel, with a high ultimate tensile stress, are responsible
for its present increasing use.</p>

<h3>Aluminium.</h3>

<p>The present use of aluminium is restricted to the cowling
of the engine, and occasionally as a body covering. Although
it is light in weight, its extremely low strength values render
it of very little use for other purposes. It attained some
measure of popularity in the early days of aviation, particularly
for the manufacture of different strut-sockets, which were
cast from aluminium; but the general bulkiness of the fittings,
in addition to the fact that it was generally necessary to incorporate
a steel lug to form the wire anchorage, caused it to
gradually fall into disuse. The tendency of aluminium to
flake and corrode, which is intensified by the action of salt
water, also limits its use for seaplane construction. Many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
attempts have been made through various alloys to impart
greater strength to the material, and although progress has
resulted, the characteristics of most of the products are
unreliable.</p>

<h3>Duralumin.</h3>

<p>Of the different alloys, duralumin is probably the best,
although one believes that its qualities are principally the
result of special heat treatment. Its use is at present
restricted to those parts not subjected to any great tensile
strain. It is considerably less than half the weight of steel,
bulk for bulk, and, properly used, may effect a considerable
saving in weight. The fact that it has not achieved the
popularity it deserves may be ascribed to the difficulties
experienced in working it, especially for such parts as body
clips, where several bends are necessary, and to the rather
arbitrary methods in use. If properly annealed, no difficulty
should occur in obtaining a reasonably sharp bend. The process
recommended by the makers consists in heating the
metal in a muffled furnace to a temperature of approximately
350° C., and the necessary work done as soon as possible after
cooling. The importance of this is due to the fact that the
process of annealing imparts to the metal a tendency to
become brittle with time. The writer has often contended
that, where duralumin is used, it should be with a real desire
to reduce weight. Too often one sees a fitting of such lavish
dimensions as to entirely nullify the advantage of the lighter
metal.</p>

<span class="subhead">SPARS AND STRUTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Having</span> thus considered generally the chief materials of aircraft
construction, we will proceed to examine the various
types of spars and struts in present use. The main spars of
the wings are by far the most important items of the complete
structure, and very great care is always taken to ensure that
only the best of materials and workmanship are concerned
with their manufacture. Looking back at the days one
usually associates with the aero shows at Olympia, multitudinous
methods of building wing spars can be recalled.
Some composed of three-ply and ash; others, less common, of
channel steel; and a few of steel tubing, either plain or wood
filled. Various reasons and causes have combined to eliminate
these methods of construction. For instance, the spar of
channel steel proved much too flexible, although this characteristic
was no great disadvantage in those machines employing
wing-warping for lateral control, for with this arrangement
a certain amount of flexibility in the wing structure is
essential. While steel tubing is excellent for many details it
can hardly be said to be really suitable for wing spars, which
are stressed essentially as beams. Now, the strength of a
beam varies as the square of the depth of the beam, and it is
obvious that in the case of a circular steel tube the material is
evenly distributed about the neutral axis, and therefore its
strength in both horizontal and vertical directions is equal;
although employed as a strut, this feature becomes of real
value. One, however, still encounters its use on modern
machines; indeed, it must not be supposed that the progress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
made in construction generally since 1914 has tended greatly
towards a reduction in the number of different methods employed,
and this will be realized from a consideration of the
accompanying spar sections which are in use to-day on one
make of machine or another.</p>

<h3>Spar Sections.</h3>

<figure id="i_fig7" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig007.png" width="1126" height="1065" style="width: 18em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>—Solid spar.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The I section form of wing spar, shown by <a href="#i_fig7">Fig. 7</a>, is in
general use, being spindled from the solid. It is comparatively
easy to produce, which in a measure explains its
popularity, and it also disposes the material in probably the
best manner for the stresses involved. The laminated spar,
<a href="#i_fig8">Fig. 8</a>, is an improvement on the solid channelled spar; it is
stronger, will withstand distortion to a greater degree without
injury, and the strength is also more uniform than with the
solid spar. An additional point in its favour is that it is
much easier to procure three pieces of small section timber
free from defects than one large piece, which, in view of the
increasing scarcity of perfect timber, is an important consideration.

hollow spar with the solid, and neglecting the cost factor,
the writer contends that the advantage is indisputably with
the former. The tendency of the I-section spar to buckle
laterally is of much lesser moment in a hollow spar of the
type shown by <a href="#i_fig9">Fig. 9</a>, while for a given weight it shows an
increase in strength, and for equal strength it is much lighter.
A different version of the hollow spar system is that indicated
by <a href="#i_fig10">Fig. 10</a>, consisting of two channelled sections, tongued
together at the joint, the sides being stiffened with three-ply.
The disposition of the joint in a vertical plane is a distinct
improvement on the hollow spar previously considered, mainly
in that better resistance to a shearing stress is afforded.</p>

<p>The principle underlying the construction of the spar
shown by <a href="#i_fig11">Fig. 11</a>, is that in its manufacture the lengths of
wood necessary are of small section. The sides of this spar
are built up with a centre of spruce about ⅛ in. thick, to each
side of which is glued thin three-ply, these being glued,
screwed, and bradded to the flanges. The wing spar shown
in section by <a href="#i_fig12">Fig. 12</a> is unique in that it really constitutes two
spars placed closed together, the connection being formed by
the top and bottom flanges of three-ply. This spar was used
in a machine with planes of small chord, but of very deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
section, and in which no interplane wiring occurred, the
wings functioning as cantilevers. Its chief advantage is great
rigidity for a low weight, but such a spar necessitates a deep
wing section, and is not in general use.</p>

<h3>Hollow Spar Construction.</h3>

<p>The advantages of the hollow type of spar summarized
are (1) greater strength for a given weight; (2) it can be produced
from wood of small section, and is therefore a better
manufacturing proposition. On the other hand, the strength
of a hollow spar is greatly and almost entirely dependent on
the glue used. Now, however well the joint may be made,
the glue is susceptible to a damp atmosphere, and if so
affected is of greatly reduced strength, while possible depreciation
in the glue due to age renders the life of the spar a
problematic quantity. Where the various fittings occur it is
also necessary to place blocks before the spar is glued up,
which is rather an unmechanical job. The practice of forming
vertical sides of a hollow spar from three-ply is not to be
commended, by reason of the doubtful character of the glue
used in its manufacture. However, in spite of these disabilities,
there is a future for hollow spar construction in the
manufacture of the big commercial machines of the future, for
with these the question of maximum strength for minimum
weight, to permit the carrying of the greatest possible useful
load, will be a primary consideration. This, of course,
assuming that the era of the all-steel machine has not arrived.</p>

<h3>Strut Sections.</h3>

<p>In the construction of the interplane and undercarriage
struts, one does not find a very decided preference for any one
particular method, although the interplane strut spindled
from the solid to a streamline section is common to many
types of modern aircraft. The strut shown in section by
<a href="#i_fig13">Fig. 13</a> is in use for both interplane and undercarriage struts.
This consists of ordinary round section steel tubing, to which
is attached a tail piece or fairing of wood, this being <span class="locked">bound to</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter">

</figure>

<p class="in0">the tube by linen tape or fabric, doped and varnished. This
strut is of practically equal strength in both lateral and longitudinal
directions, and from this point of view is superior to
the solid spindled strut, which is usually of great strength in
the fore and aft direction, but always possesses a tendency to
buckle laterally. <a href="#i_fig14">Fig. 14</a> indicates a hollow plane strut, in
which the sides of spruce are spindled from the solid, and
glued to a central stiffening piece of ash; while <a href="#i_fig15">Fig. 15</a> is
arranged so that a stiffening web is formed in the spindling
process. Owing to the rather extensive nature of the latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
operation, one does not find many instances of its use. Where
the hollow wood struts used are not completely bound with
tape or fabric, they should at least be bound at intervals with
tape or fine twine, as there is always the possibility of the
glued joint failing under the combined attentions of rain and
heat.</p>

<p>A type of strut which is now being widely used is that of
streamline section steel tubing, drawn or rolled from the
round section. It is employed for both the interplane and
undercarriage struts, but for the latter has not given entirely
satisfactory results, owing to the tendency to buckle under
extra heavy landing shocks. This would be more pronounced
with a tube of fine section than with one possessing a bluff
contour; but in any case, a strut of parallel section, whatever
the material, is not well suited to withstand sudden shocks.
This point is referred to later. Seeing that progress is being
made with the production of a seamless streamline tapered
strut this defect should soon disappear.</p>

<p>In some machines the top plane is supported from the
fuselage by struts which are formed integrally with a horizontal
compression member, as in <a href="#i_fig16">Fig. 16</a>; the section of
the vertical struts being shown by <a href="#i_fig17">Fig. 17</a>. The ply-wood is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
cut to the shape of the complete component, and forms a tie
for the spruce layers, which are jointed at the junction of the
vertical and horizontal members.</p>

<h3>Strut Materials.</h3>

<p>Referring again to the material generally employed for
struts, <i>i.e.</i> silver spruce, it is perhaps necessary to explain
further the reasons for its predominance over ash, as on a
strength-for-weight ratio the latter wood is slightly the better
material. The points already detailed, indicate that an interplane
strut is stressed essentially in compression, and therefore
the chief characteristic of ash, great tensile strength, is of
but secondary importance. There is also the fact that, for the
same weight, spruce would be thicker, and correspondingly
more able to resist collapse. However, in machines of the
flying-boat class, where the engine is invariably mounted
between the four central plane struts, and consequently subjected
to an amount of vibration varying with the type of
engine used, ash forms the material.</p>

<h3>Tapering of Interplane Struts.</h3>

<p>The correct shaping of struts longitudinally, particularly
those for interplane use, is apparently a rather controversial
subject. Taking the case of an untapered strut, it is evident
that the greatest stress will be located at or near the centre,
so that if at this point the section is strong enough, clearly
there must be an amount of superfluous material at the ends.
By suitably reducing or tapering the strut from the centre
one can obtain the same degree of strength for less weight.
Conversely, for the same weight a much stronger strut is
possible. So it has always appeared to the writer. It is,
however, admittedly possible that unless carefully done, the
operation of tapering a strut may actually diminish the
strength. One method of tapering, that of making the maximum
cross-section at the centre, and from this point diminishing in
a straight line to the ends, is undoubtedly open to criticism,
and a way more nearly approximating to the correct method
of shaping is to reduce the cross-section at various points so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
that the finished contour is curvilinear, as in <a href="#i_fig18">Fig. 18</a>. In this
connection it is pertinent to emphasize the importance of
ensuring that all strut ends are cut to the correct bevels, and
this is particularly applicable to those struts which seat directly
in a socket. The slightest irregularity will cause considerable
distortion when assembled under the tension of the bracing
wires, and frequently the writer has seen an ostensibly perfect
strut assume the most hopeless lines directly the operation of
truing up is commenced.</p>

<h3>Design of Strut Sections.</h3>

<p>Although, strictly speaking, the design of strut shapes is
outside the scope of this book, a few remarks anent the
development of streamline may emphasize the advances made,
and also the need for careful construction. The resistance of
a body is generally considered to increase as the square of the
speed, <i>i.e.</i> double the speed and head resistance is doubled,
and while this is true for a moderate range of speeds, experiment
has proved that for high speeds, exceeding say 100 miles
per hour, resistance increases at rather less than as the square
of the speed. However, it is certain that the correct shaping
or otherwise of the struts and other exposed members, affects
generally the performance in flight of the aeroplane. The
accepted feature of all streamline forms is an easy curve,
having a fairly bluff entrance and gradually tapering to a fine
edge. The ratio of length to diameter, called the fineness
ratio, varies in modern machines, being in some instances
3 to 1 and in others 5 to 1, a good average being 4 to 1.
Considering only the point of head resistance, it would be
better to choose a section of high fineness ratio, but constructionally
such a strut would buckle sideways under a
moderate load, and therefore the cross section must be sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
to resist this. The strut section used on the earliest aeroplanes,
such as the Wright biplane, shown by <span class="locked"><a href="#i_fig19">Fig. 19</a>, is</span></p>

Ogilvy, revealed the rather interesting point that a strut
shaped as in <a href="#i_fig22">Fig. 22</a> gave the same results as a similar strut
taken to a fine edge. The reasons for the non-suitability of a
sharp-pointed section are apparent from a consideration of
<a href="#i_fig23">Fig. 23</a>, showing the action of a side wind with the resultant
dead air region.</p>

<h3>Fuselage Struts.</h3>

<figure class="figcenter">

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span>—T section fuselage strut.</figcaption>
 </figure>
</figure>

<p>In the general features of those struts associated with the
construction of the fuselage and nacelle, there is very little
diversity of practice, the majority of constructors favouring a
square spruce strut, <a href="#i_fig24">Fig. 24</a>, channelled out for lightness. A
defect with this type of strut is the tendency, engendered by
irregularities in the fittings and wiring, to buckle laterally,
although this can be obviated by the provision of a strut of
larger section at the centre and diminishing in width to the
ends. A strut not nearly so popular but nevertheless in use
is that indicated by <a href="#i_fig25">Fig. 25</a>, consisting of spruce spindled to
a T section the web being of considerable width at the centre.
It would seem that the piece of wood necessary to obtain such
a strut is out of proportion to its actual finished dimensions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
and from the standpoint of economy in both labour and
material is not justified. The circular turned and tapered
strut noticeable on a number of machines disposes the material
in probably the best manner for the conditions applicable to
this component, although it necessitates the provision of
tubular ferrules in the fuselage clip. On one modern machine
the fuselage struts are circular, but of hollow section, built up
of two pieces glued together. An obsolescent method is that
in which the strut is shaped to something approaching a
streamline section, as the fact that all aeroplane bodies are
now fabric covered renders it unnecessary.</p>

<span class="subhead">PLANE CONSTRUCTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Of</span> the various components which comprise the complete
machine, the wings, aerofoils, or planes, as these items are
variously designated, may be said to contribute the greater
part of the ultimate success of the complete machine. The
aerodynamical properties of a wing are now fairly well determined,
and have been the subject of a great number of
experiments, resulting in the clearing away of many hazy
ideas and notions, so that the actual design of the wing section
for machines of given purpose is almost standardized. From
this it might be deduced that the methods of construction
were equally well determined, and although absolute uniformity
of practice does not exist, the wing construction of
most machines is similar, as far as the main assembly is
concerned.</p>

<h3>Effects of Standardization.</h3>

<p>Incidentally, one may point out the detrimental effects of
undue standardization as applied to an industry in its preliminary
stages. These effects are well exemplified by certain
machines, in which standardization has been studied to an
almost meticulous extent, with the logical result that their
performance is considerably inferior to that of other machines
of contemporary design, but in which desirable improvements
are incorporated as they occur. Although at present one
cannot give actual figures, the average performance of modern
British aircraft in range of speeds, rate and extent of climb is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
superior to the products of any other country, and one certainly
cannot cite the construction of the average British
machine as an example of standardization. Seeing that, as a
typical instance, wing sections are frequently altered in minor
detail, the impracticability of standardization is apparent, for
this would entail, to a firm wishing to keep pace with developments,
a considerable loss, through scrapping of jigs, etc.,
consequent upon the new design. When the principles of
aeroplane design are as well defined as those pertaining to
internal combustion engines, one may expect the various
manufacturers to produce one type of machine per year, and
the various improvements adduced from the year’s experience
would be incorporated in the type of the succeeding year.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>—Plan view of wing assembly.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>However, leaving the realms of vaticination for the more
prosaic subject of wing construction, it will be realized that
the process of producing the full-sized wing, accurately conforming
to the measurements, etc., deduced from experiment,
and so constructed that the chief characteristic of the section
will permanently remain, is of importance. As one or two of
the spar sections in use were dealt with in the first chapter,
it will be unnecessary again to consider them in detail.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fig26">Fig. 26</a> shows diagrammatically the plan view of a wing
assembly typical of modern practice, so far as the disposition
of the various components is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<h3>Shaping of Main Spars.</h3>

<figure id="i_fig27" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig027.png" width="2392" height="439" style="width: 38em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>—Shaping of main spars.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Taking in greater detail the different parts, it is apparent
that the spars form the nucleus of the general arrangement.
There are two methods of shaping the spar longitudinally,
and, as shown by <a href="#i_fig27">Fig. 27</a>, the one consists of leaving it
parallel for the greater part of its length, while the end forming
the tip of the wing is gradually tapered to a comparatively
fine edge. This may be said to constitute prevailing practice.
The other method which is illustrative of monoplane practice
is not used to anything like the same extent, and differs in
that it is constantly tapering from root to tip. The advantage
of this spar construction is the improved distribution of the
material for the stresses involved, and also that a wing built
with this spar may possibly possess a greater degree of lateral
stability owing to the weight of the complete wing being
located nearer the centre of gravity. Against this one must
balance the fact that each rib must necessarily be different in
contour, entailing a greater number of jigs, an increase in the
time taken in building, with a consequent increase in cost. In
addition, all strut fittings would differ in size, so that, taking
all things into consideration, this construction is hardly justified.
It will be noted that at the point of attachment of the
interplane strut fittings, or, in the case of the monoplane
wing, the anchorage for the wires, the spar is left solid. It is
possible to channel the spar right through, from root to tip,
and to glue blocks where fittings occur; and although there is
a possible saving of labour thereby, it hardly conforms to the
standards of modern workshop practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<h3>Defects of Glue in Wing Spars.</h3>

<p>Although gluing is a most necessary operation in modern
wing construction, it is not what one would call an engineering
proposition. It has a tendency to deteriorate with time,
especially if exposed to a humid atmosphere. A great deal
depends on the method of making the joint, and an operation
such as gluing a laminated wing spar is usually carried out in
a special room of certain temperature. Such spars are generally
additionally fixed by rivets, bolts, or screws through the
flanges. The material should always be dry, and as straight
and close-grained as can be procured. The straightness and
closeness of grain affect the strength to a remarkable degree;
and here it may be remarked that the use of the best material
is a most important factor for ensuring sound construction,
and one that in the end pays. If a spar should happen to be
cut from a wet log, it may in the interval between its finishing
as a part and subsequent assembly in the wing cast or warp,
which may cause trouble in assembling, and is more likely to
result in eventually being sawn up as scrap. The resultant
section of any wing is really dependent upon the spar being of
correct section, and should the spar be out of “truth,” the
section will vary at different points. This may not be eradicated
even in the erection of the machine, so that finally the
actual flying properties of the machine will be affected—another
illustration of the importance of thorough construction
in ensuring a good and lasting performance. To secure
uniformity and interchangeability the wing spars are set out
for the wing positions, and the necessary holes for the fittings
drilled to jig, before being handed over to the wing erectors.</p>

<h3>Arrangement of Planes.</h3>

<p>The usual arrangement on machines of the scout type is
for the lower plane to butt against the lower members of the
fuselage, and the top planes being the same span, the width
of the body is made up by a centre plane. Another method is
to make the top plane in two portions only, thus obviating the
centre plane; and occasionally the spars of the top plane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
run through, from wing-tip to wing-tip, although this is only
possible in machines of small span. Apart from the fact that
such a wing requires extra room, it is difficult to procure
timber of length exceeding 20 ft. sufficiently straight in the
grain; and a minor detail would be the difficulty of repair, as
a damaged wing-tip would practically entail a new spar, as
splicing, although permissible in some parts of the machine,
should not be tolerated as a means of repairing wing spars.</p>

<p>The difficulty of obtaining timber will necessitate the
wings of large machines being made in sections; and there
are several instances where this form of construction has been
adopted, in one case the sections being only five feet in length.
This construction seems eminently suited to the post-war
sporting machine, as chance damage would be confined to a
smaller area, transport simplified, and, providing the joints
are well made, no appreciable loss in efficiency should ensue.</p>

<h3>Types of Wing Ribs in Use.</h3>

<p>From a survey of the plane diagram, <a href="#i_fig26">Fig. 26</a>, it will be
noticed that the chief components, in addition to the main
spars, are the ribs, box-ribs, stringers, and leading and trailing
edges.</p>

<figure id="i_fig28" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig028.png" width="2412" height="277" style="width: 38em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>—Construction of ribs.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The ribs, which is the term applied to the very light
framework built over the spars to maintain the correct curvature,
are variously constructed; one of the most popular
methods in vogue is that shown by <a href="#i_fig28">Fig. 28</a>. The central
portion, or web, which includes the nose and trailing edge
formers, may be cut from either spruce, whitewood, cotton
wood, which can be bent to a surprising degree without
fracture, and three-ply. Three-ply, while excellent for some
items, is hardly suited for this purpose, as the laminations
have a tendency to come apart, especially in the lower grades,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
which is aggravated by the screws or brads necessary for the
attachment of the flange. A rib, fretted out as in <a href="#i_fig28">Fig. 28</a>,
with the web of cotton wood and a spruce flange, can be made
extremely light. A rib for a chord of from 4 ft. 6 in. to 5 ft.
would weigh about 5½ oz. As it is very necessary that every
rib should correspond, these parts should be made to a metal
jig, which is about the only way to ensure exactitude. This
should be made from mild sheet steel, about 16 B.W.G., and
need only be shaped to the outer curve, as the lightening
holes are of but secondary importance, these being usually
marked out in the saw mill, and cut to the line with a fine jig
saw. For production in quantity a box jig, between which a
dozen ribs might be clamped and shaped, is preferable.
Templates of wood are of doubtful accuracy, for not only do
corners wear, but gradual shrinkage soon renders them useless.
The incorrect shaping of the most insignificant piece of
wood may have far-reaching effects when assembled, and
any extra trouble taken in the preparation of parts is
more than repaid by the subsequent ease and precision of
erection.</p>

<p>While the method of rib building previously described
constitutes general practice, there are, of course, other arrangements
in vogue. <a href="#i_fig29">Fig. 29</a> illustrates a system in which the
front spar forms the leading edge, a procedure which is somewhat
rare now, owing to the features of modern wing sections,
but at one time quite common. In this case the web is of
three-ply lightened with a series of graduated holes, according
to the width of the web, and the flanges of spruce.</p>

<p>The rib assembly, <a href="#i_fig30">Fig. 30</a>, is extremely simple and light,
as in this case the web proper is superseded by thin strips of
three-ply, glued and bradded each side of the spruce flange.
The amount of woodwork between the spars is reduced to a
minimum, although one can hardly imagine such a system
answering for a chord over five feet. Even then the wing
curvature would require to be fairly simple, as a pronounced
curve would flatten out. As a point of fact, this assembly is
rarely used for chords exceeding 4 ft. 6 in. In another arrangement
as shown in <a href="#i_fig31">Fig. 31</a>, the connection between the top and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
bottom flanges is formed by blocks, a method which is
certainly economical of material.</p>

</div>

<p>An interesting form of rib design is that shown by <a href="#i_fig32">Fig. 32</a>,
and in this instance the fretting is specially designed to prevent
any flattening out of the camber. The rib section is
shown at A, <a href="#i_fig32">Fig. 32</a>, and it will be noticed that the flange of
chamfered section is grooved to take the three-ply web. The
vertical parts of the web are stiffened by small semi-circular
fillets.</p>

<h3>Ribs under Compression.</h3>

<p>For those ribs contiguous to the interstrut joints, a
different construction is necessary to withstand the tension of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
the cross-bracing of the planes and, to a lesser degree, the
internal plane wiring, so that at this point the rib performs
two functions, that of maintaining the wing curve, and also
taking the strains due to compression. Where such provision
is not made, the tension of the wiring will result in either or
possibly both of the following: (1) the rib will buckle laterally;
(2) the camber will increase to an extent varying with the
pressure on the wires, both results being extremely detrimental
to efficiency. In this respect the old box-kites of varying origin
used to offer some interesting studies in variable camber, and
when it is remembered that the wing ribs were commonly
composed of a single ash lath, steamed to shape, and the fabric
attached on the top side only, the wonder is that extended flying
was possible at all. For all that, some comparatively classic
cross-country flights were accomplished. One popular system
is to incorporate a box-rib at these points, sometimes made
by placing two ordinary ribs close together and connecting
them with three-ply or thin spruce, so that, although the overall
width of the finished box-rib would be approximately 2 in.,
it is exceptionally rigid and withal light.</p>

<figure id="i_fig33" class="figcenter">

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>—Compression rib.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another solution is to use a solid web, lightly channelled
out, as in <a href="#i_fig33">Fig. 33</a>.</p>

<p>In some wing structures the ribs are uniform throughout,
a strut of either steel tube or wood being inserted and to which
the internal wiring is attached. This latter method is possibly
more desirable, that is, if the joint between the compression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
strut and spar can be combined with the interstrut fitting.
This may necessitate a little extra work in the latter, but this
is preferable to the use of a separate fitting, involving additional
piercing of the spar.</p>

<h3>Importance of Even Contour.</h3>

<p>Whilst on the subject of rib building, one cannot over
emphasize the desirability of even contour, and the template,
illustrated by <a href="#i_fig34">Fig. 34</a>, serves as an admirable check. It is cut
from very dry material to the outside curve of the section, and
if this is tried on as each rib is fixed, one may be sure of comparative
uniformity. The root rib is generally of stouter
construction, and usually follows the same lines as the compression
ribs. At this point the pull of the fabric has to be
contended with, which is not infrequently a considerable strain.
The same conditions prevail at the wing tip, which is one
reason against excessive reduction of material at this point.
Instances occur where the tension of the fabric after doping
has considerably deformed the tip curve, which is at least
unsightly, and may entail reconstruction.</p>

<h3>Wing Tip Details.</h3>

<p>The actual shape of the wing tip varies with the make of
machine, and forms one of the distinctive features of the complete
assembly. There is a general tendency to rake the
ends, making the back spar longer than the front, on the
score that increased efficiency due to reduction of end losses
is attained. While this is somewhat problematic, seeing that
several notable machines have square tips, and some actually
constructed with the longest edge leading, it undoubtedly
imparts a pleasing and distinctive appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>The actual construction is largely a matter for individual
preference, as there are several ways of forming it. For
instance, a single piece of ash may be bent to shape, or it may
be cut out in sections from spruce boards and glued together
with a long splice, while in another instance oval steel tube
is the material. This small section steel tubing seems admirably
suited for such items as wing tips, trailing edges, and the
various components of the empennage, such as the fixed
stabilizer, elevators, fin, and rudder.</p>

<p>Another method of construction used for the wing tips of
some machines consists of a number of strips, about six for
a wing tip 1 in. wide by ¼ in. thick, the joints between which
are disposed vertically, forming a laminated wing tip. In
manufacture, each piece is bent round bending jigs or blocks
of the required shape, the edges of the strips having previously
been glued. It is apparent that the smaller the section of
strip used, the easier it can be bent, and with this arrangement
quite sharp bends can be successfully formed in spruce.
The alternative method of steaming a solid piece is often
wasteful, apart from the fact that it enforces the use of ash.</p>

<span class="subhead">DETAILS OF PLANE CONSTRUCTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> tendency to lose lift, pronounced in some machines,
hardly noticeable in others, may be directly traced and
attributed to the manner in which the wings are built, which
is largely dependent upon the design. In the preliminary
stages of design it is usual to take as a basis the figures for
lift and drift of a known tested section, that is if facilities are
not available for testing an exact scale model of the section it
is intended to use. Anyway, the whole design is dependent
upon these figures, in respect of both the maximum and
minimum speeds, and also the rate of climb, and the extent to
which the actual performance of the machine complies with
these calculations is determined solely by the exactitude and
precision with which the full-size wing conforms to the scale
model. By this means only is it possible to design with any
degree of accuracy.</p>

<h3>The Sagging of Fabric.</h3>

<p>The sagging of the fabric between the ribs is one of the
principal reasons for the failure of the finished machine to
satisfy expectation and also of the tendency to lose lift. One
or two causes contribute to this result. One is the spacing
of the ribs, which in some cases is not nearly close enough.
A rough average spacing is from 10 ins. to 1 ft., but in
modern high-speed machines, loaded to anything from 5 lbs.
to 8 lbs. per square foot, the spacing should be much closer.
In addition, the ribs near the wing root should be closer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
than those at the tip, for at this point the stresses are
greater, a certain amount of vibration from the engine having
to be contended with, in addition to the effects of the slip-stream
of the air-screw. Particularly noticeable is the tendency
for the fabric to sag down on the top surface of the
leading edge, a feature which imparts to the machine, especially
when viewed from the front, a not unpleasing corrugated
appearance. At this part of the section the curve is somewhat
sharp, and naturally the fabric tends to conform to the
definition of the shortest distance between two points, a
straight line. This, of course, is aggravated in flight, when
the planes are under load, and by far the greatest amount of
pressure is located at the front portion, or leading edge, of
the wing.</p>

<h3>False Ribs.</h3>

<figure id="i_fig35" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig035.png" width="952" height="968" style="width: 15em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="small"><i>FALSE RIBS</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span>—Arrangement of ribs at leading edge.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In some wing constructions the forces are minimized by
the provision of subsidiary or false nose-ribs, <a href="#i_fig35">Fig. 35</a>, which
extend usually from the leading edge as far back as the front
spar and occasionally to the longitudinal stringer. While
this prevents, to a certain extent, the sagging in of the fabric,
it does not entirely eradicate it. The only successful way in
which the characteristics of the wing contour may be preserved
is by covering the leading edge with thin veneer, spruce, or,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
still better, three-ply, as <a href="#i_fig36">Fig. 36</a>. Despite the great advantages
attending this constructional feature, its use cannot be said to
be really extended.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span>—Three-ply covering for leading edge.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Pressure at Leading Edge.</h3>

<p>The pressure at the leading edge produced by the enormous
speed at which the modern machines fly (and the maximum
diving speed of which, owing to the reduction of resistance, is
correspondingly increased) must be abnormal, and calls for
different methods of construction from those which at present
obtain. There is at least one case on record where the fabric
has burst at this point with fatal results. It is interesting to
note that in the report of the N.P.L. for the year 1916–17
mention is made of the deformation of the wing form, due to
the sagging of the fabric, which has been reproduced in model
form, so that the allowances to be made and the resultant
effects have been determined.</p>

<h3>Effect of Lateral Control.</h3>

<p>The system adopted for the lateral control is a decisive
factor in deciding the general lines of construction. The
arrangement of plane warping, whereby the wing was twisted
or warped from root to tip, or the outer section only, has
given place to the almost universal use of aileron control.
With the old warping system the ribs, spars, and the whole
wing collectively was subjected to a torsional strain, which
could only have had a deleterious effect upon it. This fact
was almost entirely responsible for the practice of using steel
tube for wing spars, for by its use it was a fairly easy matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
to arrange the ribs to slide or hinge upon the tube, which,
at least, relieved some of the torsional stress.</p>

<h3>Leading and Trailing Edges.</h3>

<figure id="i_fig37" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig037.png" width="1174" height="471" style="width: 19em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 37.</span>—Leading edges.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The average practice concerning the formation of the
leading and trailing edges is shown by <a href="#i_fig37">Figs. 37</a> and <a href="#i_fig38">38</a>.
Where the section in use requires a bluff entry the spindled-out
nose-piece is applicable, while for a sharp entry a fillet let
into the nose-formers suffices. As previously mentioned,
steel tubing makes a satisfactory trailing edge, although somewhat
heavier than the spruce strip, while an extremely fine
leading edge can be formed by steel wire. The edge, under
pressure of the fabric, assumes a variegated shape, a distinctive
feature of some types, but, nevertheless, a wire trailing edge is
somewhat flabby and undulating, and as a method is obsolescent.
Longitudinal stringers are employed to preserve the
wing contour and also for a stiffening medium for the ribs in
a lateral direction. About the only variation of the small
spruce strip for the purpose is linen tape, crossed alternately.</p>

<h3>Efficiency of the Raked Wing Tip.</h3>

<p>In the previous chapter mention was made of the probable
gain in efficiency resulting from the raked wing tip, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
this has some foundation in fact will be apparent from a
consideration of <a href="#i_fig39">Fig. 39</a>, which illustrates the flow of air across
a plane, as generally accepted. Where the plane surface is
continuous from wing tip to wing tip, the provision of the
shaped tip would appear to compensate for any slight loss, but
there are instances where the extent of the pilot’s range of
view is of the utmost importance, and this may necessitate the
cutting away of a portion of the centre section (which sometimes
affords the only means of ingress and egress), or the
root of the lower plane, as in <a href="#i_fig40">Fig. 40</a>.</p>

<h3>Wing Baffles.</h3>

<p>An attempt to prevent air leakage caused by this is
occasionally observed in the employment of vertical vanes, or
wing baffles. In the case of a machine with the lower plane
abutting against the side of the fuselage, these would not be
necessary, the fuselage acting in the same manner. The
baffles are usually of three-ply or spruce, and shaped to project
above the top and bottom surfaces, this projection rarely
exceeding six inches. A typical arrangement is illustrated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
<a href="#i_fig41">Fig. 41</a>, which also shows the exposed spars streamlined with
a fairing of three-ply. It is typical of the varied opinions
which still exist, that on some machines the wing roots are
merely washed out somewhat abruptly. If this air leakage is
of any moment, it is apparent that it must detrimentally affect
the lift-drift ratio. As a proof of the existence of pressure at
the openings in the wing, the writer remembers the case of a
well-known seaplane, where the wing baffles on the centre
section were made of somewhat thin three-ply. In flight it
was noticed by the pilot that these were being forced away
from the wing, and subsequently these were replaced by
baffles of stouter construction.</p>

</figure>

<h3>Metal Wing Construction.</h3>

<p>Of two machines, equal in air performance, the one which
can be most easily produced has an obvious and, especially at
the present time, a very important superiority. Rapidity of
production is a most cogent argument in favour of metal construction,
for once the necessary machines are set up, and the
jigs and dies made, and given a constant supply of material,
output is only limited by the speed of the machine. In
addition, there are the very exacting demands of interchangeability.
Now, it is infinitely more easy to obtain
exactitude in metal than in wood, and, moreover, assuming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
that it is possible to produce woodwork to the nearest ·01 of
an inch, what preventive is there against shrinkage, which
occurs even when using the dryest of timber. By the more
extensive use of metal there should be a considerably reduced
proportion of scrapped parts, and erection would be accelerated.
It is significant that the planes of some of the most recent
German machines are constructed largely of steel tubing,
which is at present the most practicable form in which steel
can be used. Of course, steel tube spars are quite an old
detail, although the more general English practice is to core
them with spruce or ash, as in <a href="#i_fig42">Fig. 42</a>. One <span class="locked">remembers a</span></p>

<figure id="i_fig42" class="figcenter">

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span>—Steel tube spar with wood filling.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="in0">monoplane, built some time before the war, in which the spars
and ribs were of steel and the covering of thin aluminium
sheet. In flight this machine was particularly fast, which may
be accounted for by the reduction of skin friction, which a
smooth surface such as aluminium would afford. In addition,
the tendency of a fabric covering to sag was also obviated.
Another example of metal construction is afforded by the
Clement-Bayard monoplane, exhibited at Olympia in 1914.
The plane construction of this machine, as shown by <a href="#i_fig43">Fig. 43</a>,
consisted of channel steel spars, steel leading and trailing edges,
and thin steel strips replacing the usual wooden stringers.
However, steel construction in modern English machines is
restricted to the various organs of the empennage, and occasionally
one finds ailerons so built. There seems no valid
reason for the continued use of wood as the material for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
construction of such items as the fin, rudder, and elevators, as
a considerable saving of labour and time can be effected by
using the various forms of steel tubing; moreover, the
tendency which most controlling organs built of wood have to
warp and twist with variations in temperature is prevented
by the steel frame. One frequently sees such items as the
ailerons and elevators distorted, which must result in excessive
drift, if not erratic flying. At the present time it is difficult to
obtain aluminium alloy in any large quantity, and this, in
conjunction with the present high prices, precludes its extensive
use. When this material is procurable in quantity, and
when design is reasonably standardized, rolled or lattice spars
and stamped ribs may come into vogue.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.</span>—Rib construction with metal spars.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Fabric Attachment.</h3>

<p>Fabric and its attachment is a matter requiring considerable
attention, with the great pressure to which modern wings
are subjected. In the old days any fabric which was light
with a moderate degree of strength was utilized. Nowadays,
it is required to stand a certain strain in warp and weft, and
rightly so, since the bursting of fabric in flight can only have
one result. It is interesting to note that the fabric used on
the Deperdussin hydro-monoplane was specially woven with
threads running at right angles, forming innumerable squares.
The purpose of this was that, should a bullet or any object
pierce any one of the squares, damage would be confined to
that square, and thereby prevented from developing; but the
writer cannot recall any instance of its use to-day.</p>

<p>In covering, the fabric should be tightly and evenly
stretched from end to end of the wing, and only comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
lightly pulled from leading to trailing edge. If too much strain
is applied to the fabric crosswise it will result in undulations
between each rib. The tendency of fabric to sag between the
ribs is accentuated by this, and, of course, matters are not
improved upon the application of the dope. It should be
remembered that the efficiency of any machine is greatly
dependent upon the tautness of the fabric. It should not be
stretched too tightly, as the application of the specified coats
of dope may result in the fibres or threads of the material
being overstrained.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span>—Attachment of fabric to ribs by cane strips.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With regard to the actual attachment of the covering to
the wing framework modern practice is restricted to two
methods. The older method is illustrated by <a href="#i_fig44">Fig. 44</a>, and
consists of strips of spruce, or more usually cane, tacked or
screwed to the ribs. It is usual, and certainly preferable, to
affix this beading to every rib of those sections of the planes
adjacent to the fuselage, as the fabric on these portions is
subjected to the slip stream of the propeller, which meets it in
a succession of small blows. The fabric in the outer sections
need only be affixed to alternate ribs. The alternate method
is shown by <a href="#i_fig45">Fig. 45</a>. In this case the fabric is sewn <span class="locked">to the</span></p>

<figure id="i_fig45" class="figcenter">

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 45.</span>—Fabric sewn to ribs.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="in0">ribs with twine or cord, the stitches occurring about every three
inches. It will be noted that every loop or stitch is locked
with a species of half-hitch knot. This stitching is then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
covered with bands of fabric, the edges being frayed to ensure
perfect adhesion and doped to the main cover. It is largely a
matter of opinion which system ensures the most even wing
contour, although it would seem that the drift or resistance is
slightly lessened by the sewing method. An obsolete method
is that in which the fabric was tacked to the ribs with brass
pins and taped with linen tape. All sewn joints in wing
covers should be, and generally are, of the double lapped
variety (<a href="#i_fig46">Fig. 46</a>), and arranged to run diagonally across the
wing. A minor and somewhat insignificant detail <span class="locked">of wing</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span>—Double-lapped joint in fabric.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="in0">covering is the provision of small eyelet holes in the under
surface of the trailing edge, allowing water accumulated
through condensation to drain away, and although not general
practice, would appear to be necessary. A refinement which
may be necessary on the post-war sporting machine is the
attachment of small blocks, or “domes of silence,” to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
leading edge, as a protection for the fabric against wear.
When planes are dissembled more often than not they are
stacked leading edge downwards on a concrete floor, and any
movement or friction is likely to result in the rubbing away
of the fabric, which, if unnoticed, may result in the bursting
of the covering. Such fitments would hardly constitute an
innovation, as the writer has distinct recollections of seeing
such fittings on the D.F.W. biplane at Brooklands just prior
to the outbreak of war. These consisted of brass balls, free
to rotate in a socket, screwed to the leading edge. A narrow
strip of aluminium screwed along the entering edge would
be quite sufficient, and would not add appreciably to the
weight.</p>

<span class="subhead">INTERPLANE STRUT CONNECTIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> may be taken as fairly conclusive that for war purposes the
biplane has proved its superiority, and it appears also that for
the commercial requirements of the future it is suited still
better, and therefore, in view of the huge possibilities thus
opened up, is likely to maintain this predominance.</p>

<p>As the arrangement of planes in a biplane forms the
extremely simple yet enormously efficient box-girder, it is
generally considered superior in strength to weight requirements,
although for monoplanes of small span it is doubtful
if this is so, which affords some indication of the possibilities
of the small monoplane as the sporting machine of the days
to come. Seeing that the principal difference between the
biplane and monoplane consists essentially in the type of
truss employed, the arrangement and attachment of the
various members peculiar to the biplane truss becomes of
interest, certainly of importance. It is intended to deal with
the various trusses in a later chapter, confining the present
remarks to the interplane strut fittings in use, and commencing
by detailing the chief requirements and desirable
features. The most desirable requirement is that the attachment
of the fitting to the wing spars does not involve the
drilling of the spar. In practice this is most difficult of
accomplishment, for while no great trouble would be experienced
in making a fitting fulfilling this requirement, it
would be quite another matter to keep it in place under the
tension of the bracing wires, and in the case of the outer strut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
fitting, to which any strain is ultimately transmitted, practically
impossible. In spite of this, it must be remembered
that the machine may occasionally, when landing or getting
off, pitch over on to the wing-tip skid, and if severe, the shock
transmitted to the spar may cause a fracture to develop which,
starting at the hole due to the strut fitting, and owing to the
fabric covering, would be difficult to detect. One or two
similar mishaps, with a consequent increase in the extent of
the fracture, give distinct possibilities of collapse in the air.
Although one cannot give specific instances, it is a feasible
contingency, and one that should be eliminated from the
region of possibility.</p>

<p>Additional important features are the provision for rapid
assembly and detachment, ease of manufacture, and the
absence of brazing, welding and soldering as mediums for
forming connections, at least for those parts subject to any
stress.</p>

<p>The qualities of strong construction and good design are
paramount considerations in the manufacture of these fittings,
as the purpose of an interstrut joint is not merely to form a
connection between the upper and lower planes, but also to
distribute the intricate stresses encountered in flight.</p>

<h3>Brazing and Welding.</h3>

<p>It is somewhat amazing that brazing as an essential
operation in the making of a joint should still be employed, as
it is difficult to imagine anything less suited to the conditions
under which aircraft operate. The advantages of a uniform
high-grade steel possessing a high ultimate tensile strength
are dissipated by the intense heat necessary for the action of
brazing, resulting in the strength of the finished joint becoming
an extremely problematic quantity, indeed this is
rendered the more so by the individuality of the workmen.</p>

<p>Welding properly performed is less objectionable, indeed,
its use may be said to be constantly increasing, although it is
well to recognize its limitations. It should not be used for
parts subject to any great tensile stress, such as the fittings
forming the subject of this chapter. The efficiency of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
welded joint is hard to determine, as apparent soundness on
the surface is no indication of the internal nature of the weld.
Regarded from the aphoristic “maximum strength for minimum
weight” view point, and taking into account the
advantages in this direction which can be obtained by the use
of a high-grade steel, brazing and welding are not to be
commended.</p>

<p>The operation of soft soldering, requiring only a moderate
heat, does not weaken the material to any great extent, and
for some items a properly pegged and soldered joint is superior
to the two methods of jointing previously described.</p>

<h3>Connections in Use.</h3>

<p>The illustrations given indicate the varying degrees of
practice, taking as the standard for comparison the early
Wright socket, <a href="#i_fig47">Fig. 47</a>. Although somewhat crude it was
quite suitable for the purpose, especially as the wing warping
system in the Wright machines necessitated a fair amount of
flexibility in the joints. It serves also to illustrate that some
advancement has been made in constructional work. The
advantages of rapid erection and dismantling have been
realized and provided for in most machines since the early
days of the industry, and it is not surprising, therefore, that
the salient characteristic of the joint (<a href="#i_fig48">Fig. 48</a>) used by S.&nbsp;F.
Cody on his famous biplane was portability. The interstrut
terminates in a kind of fork, which in turn is pinned to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
head of a special bolt slotted to receive it. The fact that the
wiring lugs were improvised from chain links is interesting.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48.</span>—Interplane strut attachment.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The method of packing the wings for transport consisted
in detaching the two outer cellules from the central structure,
when the removal of one set of wires enabled the planes to be
folded one against the other. It is possibly of interest to
record the fact that in the military trials of 1912 this machine
was taken down and re-erected in 51 minutes, quite a good
performance taking into account its large dimensions.
Although this attribute is scarcely necessary at the present
time, it will be undoubtedly required by the sporting owner of
the future with limited storage facilities. The <span class="locked">fitting shown</span></p>

pressed out, the lugs bent to the different angles, and then

<p>The practice of anchoring wires to eyebolts, as in <a href="#i_fig51">Fig. 51</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
forms the nucleus of many strut connections, but as a method
cannot be recommended. Continual strain on the wire has a
resultant in the bending over of the head of the eyebolt as in
<a href="#i_fig52">Fig. 52</a>. As a point of fact the use of the eyebolt is distinctly
elementary, and gives the impression of a makeshift. The
fitting illustrated by <a href="#i_fig53">Fig. 53</a> constitutes an advance on the
previous arrangements dealt with, and is also indicative of
modern practice.</p>

sheet-steel, bent up to the section of the spar, the bolts, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
will be noticed, passing horizontally through it. The anchorage
for the wires is formed by lugs, which have a direct pull
on the bolts, and is so arranged that a slight clearance exists
between lug and spar.</p>

</figure>

<p>The plane-strut is shod with steel tubing, and connected
to the fitting by a bolt, as shown. Of the strut connections
described so far, hardly one can be said to conform to the
leading principle of the ideal fitting, <i>i.e.</i> the secure attachment
to the spar without piercing the latter for bolts. <a href="#i_fig54">Fig. 54</a>
gives a fitting which is as good a solution of the problem as is
constructionally possible. The basis of this connection is the
lug-plate, to which is welded the strut-socket, the whole being
fastened to the spar by four bolts, which are let in the flange
of the spar just half their diameter, and tighten on a washer-plate
on the opposite side. Lateral movement along the spars
is thus adequately prevented, although the outer strut-socket
might conveniently be bolted right through the spar, without
materially reducing the strength thereof. This is made possible
by the fact that the wing spars, disregarding the small
wash-out at the extreme tip, are generally parallel in depth
from root to tip, the amount of material at the point of intersection
of the plane-strut being in excess of that necessary for
the stresses concerned. Another attachment achieving similar
results is shown in the diagram (<a href="#i_fig55">Fig. 55</a>), forming an example
of the fitting employed on the pre-war Avro biplane. It will
be noticed that in this case two bolts only are used for the
connection, the pull of the flying or lift-wires being counteracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
by the duplicated wires taken from the washer-plate to a
fitting located on the single central skid of the undercarriage.</p>

<h3>Head Resistance of Strut Sockets.</h3>

<p>A point calling for comment is the apparent oversight or
neglect of the amount of head resistance offered by the average
strut fitting, although great care is taken to ensure the strut
and wing sections being of correct form. It seems probable
that some difference must occur, especially at the high speeds
now prevalent, between the air flow across the plane and that
which meets the strut terminal. Anyway, some discontinuity
of flow exists, and whether or no the aggregate resistance of
all the fittings is of any great moment provides matter for discussion.
It is quite possible to fair off any irregularities in
air-flow due to the strut connections by the attachment of
sheet-aluminium fairings, which could be beaten, pressed, or
spun with little difficulty. Although examples of this practice
are very little in evidence, the writer inclines to the belief that
the additional weight would be negligible compared with the
ensuing reduction in head resistance.</p>

<p>The foregoing examples cannot be said to constitute the
latest practice, nor is it possible under present conditions to
give such details, but sufficient has been said to indicate the
progress and trend of design.</p>

<span class="subhead">WING-TRUSSING SYSTEMS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Although</span> the trussing of aeroplanes is carried out along certain
well-defined lines, there are occasional divergences from
the orthodox. The differences now existing are not nearly so
great as those of former days, this being explained by the fact
that the progress of any science or industry tends towards
uniformity of method, while practical experience eliminates
the undesirable systems. This does not necessarily mean
that the present methods in vogue are incapable of improvement,
but merely denotes their suitability for present
requirements.</p>

<h3>The Pratt Truss.</h3>

<figure id="i_fig56" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig056.png" width="1155" height="191" style="width: 19em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 56.</span>—The Pratt truss.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The basis of all modern trussing systems, with modifications,
is the Pratt truss (<a href="#i_fig56">Fig. 56</a>), familiar in bridge-building
circles, the basic principle of which is that the compression
members are disposed vertically, and while of minimum
length are most favourably placed for obtaining the maximum
efficiency. There are other types of trusses used in structural
engineering, as, for instance, the Howe truss, in which the
compression members are arranged diagonally, and the
Warren lattice-type girder; but for various reasons these are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
not applicable to the needs of aeronautical engineering. But
a brief consideration of the chief features of the Pratt or box-girder
system of trussing will suffice to illustrate its great
advantages for aircraft work, particularly for machines
exceeding a certain span; and it is this limiting span to which
a monoplane can safely and efficiently be built which is
largely responsible for its present spell of unpopularity.</p>

<h3>Monoplane Trussing.</h3>

<p>From the standpoint of simplicity, the monoplane equals
the biplane. As each wing of the former may be considered
as a cantilever, it is the difficulty of adequately staying the
wings above a certain span which forms the deterrent feature,
for it is obvious that, as the span increases, in order to obtain
a reasonable angle for the wires, the king post, or cabane,
must be increased in height. This would necessitate an
ungainly undercarriage, less able to withstand rough landings,
with a consequent increase in both weight and head resistance.
However, it seems that the monoplane will have a
future for sporting purposes, where the span will not exceed
30 ft., and will probably be nearer 20 ft.</p>

<figure id="i_fig57" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig057.png" width="1155" height="289" style="width: 19em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 57.</span>—Monoplane wing bracing.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Various attempts have been made to obviate this inherent
defect of the monoplane system of trussing, the first and most
popular being the king-post system (<a href="#i_fig57">Fig. 57</a>), in which short
masts are incorporated in the wing structure and wire-braced
to the spars. From the points formed by the crossing of the
mast and spar the main bracing-wires are taken. That this
system is of real use is demonstrated by the fact that, amongst
others, the Antoinette, Flanders, and Martinsyde monoplanes
incorporated this system. It is worthy of note that this
system also characterized the huge Martinsyde trans-Atlantic
’bus, the wing-spread being in the neighbourhood of 70 ft.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
Another original attempt at improvement, the wing-bracing of
the Deperdussin hydro-monoplane, is of interest (<a href="#i_fig58">Fig. 58</a>). As
regards the bracing, the machine was virtually a biplane, the
wings being stayed by a steel tube running parallel with the
wings, and connected to it at intervals by steel tubular struts,
with cross-bracing between, as in a biplane. The abolition of
the top wires rendered the machine of greater value for war
purposes than other tractor machines of that period. The
logical conclusion of this system is exemplified by the Nieuport
scouting biplane, the lower plane of which corresponds to the
streamlined steel boom of the Dep.</p>

<figure id="i_fig58" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig058.png" width="1132" height="247" style="width: 18em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.</span>—Deperdussin monoplane bracing.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Wireless Wing Structure.</h3>

<p>Superficially, it would appear that the abolition of external
trussing and wiring would make for greater aerodynamical
efficiency; and, constructionally, it would be quite possible to
build wings devoid of external staying, and at the same time
of sufficient strength. But when it is considered that this
would entail an excessive depth of spar at the root of the
wing, with a resultant increase of head resistance, it is doubtful
whether any appreciable advantage would accrue. In the
event of the wing becoming deformed or out of alignment,
re-truing up would be almost impossible, and would certainly
require the uncovering of the wing and partial reconstruction.
Contrast this with the orthodox wire bracing. It is simple of
attachment, of relatively low cost, and offers the utmost
facility for truing up. A monoplane of note, built without
external trussing, was the special Antoinette, produced for the
French military trials of 1911. This had a span of approximately
46 ft., and the depth of spar at the root was about
2 ft. 3 ins., and at the tip 9 ins., the consequent weight alone
being abnormal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<h3>Anchorage of Lift Wires.</h3>

<p>The one-time practice of anchoring lift wires to various parts
of the undercarriage is bad in principle, as there is a
distinct possibility that a rough landing may damage the wire
or its attachment, and ultimately cause failure in flight. This
practice undoubtedly arose from a desire to obtain a good angle
for the lift wires, a subsequent improvement being the addition
of a separate pylon or cabane.</p>

<h3>Biplane Trussing.</h3>

<figure id="i_fig59" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig059.png" width="1150" height="269" style="width: 18em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.</span>—Biplane Truss.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The most common form of biplane truss is shown by the
diagram (<a href="#i_fig59">Fig. 59</a>), sometimes, as in the case of various pusher
types, or those for long-distance work where a large wing area
is necessary, extended to three bays each side, which probably
explains the partiality of German designers for multiplicity of
interplane struts, as, prior to the outbreak of the war, the
majority of German machines were designed and built entirely
for long distance and duration flying. By this means light
wing loading, which entails large wing area, was possible
without prohibitive weight, for by the addition of a pair of
struts to the two-bay type, a lighter wing spar for the same
strength is possible. In this type of truss the bays adjacent
to the fuselage are varied in width, in order more easily to
apportion the stresses, which are greater at the centre of the
wing structure. A modification of <a href="#i_fig59">Fig. 59</a> is indicated by
<a href="#i_fig60">Fig. 60</a>, which illustrates diagrammatically the arrangement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
the Maurice Farman biplane, the improvement consisting of
the method of strengthening the interplane struts. The outer
strut is braced with a small king-post, and from this a wire is
taken through each side of the strut. On this machine the
struts are of the light, hollow-spar type, and this arrangement
must therefore materially reduce their tendency to buckling.</p>

<figure id="i_fig60" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig060.png" width="1150" height="217" style="width: 18em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span>—Farman wing structure.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another version of this system is that in which the top
plane is of greater span than the bottom, the extension thus
formed being stayed with lift and counter-lift wiring, or by
means of a strut acting in tension and compression.</p>

<h3>Single Strut Systems.</h3>

<p>The almost universal arrangement for the small single-seater
scout is the single bay, and from this method the
progress of design has inclined towards the elimination of as
many struts and wires as possible, which has its culminant in
the type of truss embodying one strut and one pair of wires,
lift and counter-lift, each side of the body. Quite a number
of machines have incorporated the single strut assembly, the
earliest perhaps being the Brequet, and one also remembers
a small Avro scout, the strut in this case being built up with
spars and stringers, covered with fabric. The single-lift truss
is particularly suited to multiplane construction, where the
chord of the wings is narrow, and the bending moment, due
to the movement of the centre of pressure, is correspondingly
reduced. A disadvantage exists with this form of truss similar
to that experienced with the wireless monoplane truss, <i>i.e.</i> the
difficulty of maintaining the correct incidence from root to tip.
However, some extraordinary machines of recent construction
embodying this feature, stand up to active service demands,
so that this defect can be of no great moment. A minor
detail consists in the circumstance of, for example, a lift wire
coming adrift or perhaps being shot away. With the single-lift
truss total collapse would ensue, but it is conceivable that
the ordinary double-lift truss offers more chances of escape.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span>—Wireless wing structure.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another system which obviates the need for wires is
illustrated by <a href="#i_fig61">Fig. 61</a>, which was the particular system used
on the Albatross “Arrow biplane” of 1912. A drawback is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
the difficulty of readjustment, which is the probable explanation
of its failure to come into extensive use. The direct
antithesis of this arrangement, the elimination of struts, is
indicated by <a href="#i_fig62">Fig. 62</a>; but as this embodies all the defects of
the monoplane system of trussing, even of the attachment
of wires to the undercarriage, it must be considered of no
practical utility.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span>—Biplane truss without interplane struts.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>1½ Strut Machines.</h3>

<p>The arrangement shown by <a href="#i_fig63">Fig. 63</a> is responsible for the
designation of machines so built as “1½ strutters.” A later
development of this system consists of but four centre plane
struts, the two struts forming an inverted V between the
fuselage longerons and centre being dispensed with.</p>

<figure id="i_fig63" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig063.png" width="1155" height="342" style="width: 19em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span>—1½ strut wing structure.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The system (<a href="#i_fig64">Fig. 64</a>) is illustrative of the form of staying
in use on a modern high-speed scout, and in respect of which
a patent is held. As this machine is designed with a very
small gap, the lift wires are consequently at a somewhat flat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
angle. The strut, about halfway along each wing, is hinged
at the point of intersection of the wires, which, incidentally,
do not run through from corner to corner, but are attached
in the centre to a fitting which also forms the anchorage for
the struts. By this method there is an apparent reduction
in the tendency of the wing spars to buckle under load
between the points of support.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span>—A patented wing bracing.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Drift Bracing.</h3>

<p>So far the methods dealt with denote the methods of
staying in a vertical dimension, and it remains to consider
the provision for trussing in the fore-and-aft direction. There
are two methods in use, one being to brace the wings internally,
which is the more general practice, as by this arrangement
the resistance of exposed wiring is obviated, while the
alternative method consists in taking wires from various
points along the wing to the nose and rear part of the fuselage.</p>

<h3>Properties of the Various Types.</h3>

<p>The necessity for increased size, with its inevitable sequence,
increased weight, must be realized without a very great addition
to the landing speed, the figure for the latter standing at
approximately 45–50 m.p.h. This factor greatly influences
the maximum wing loading possible, without detrimentally
affecting this, so that in the design of the large machine a
considerable increase in wing area is unavoidable. This fact
practically rules out the monoplane system for the large
aeroplane, as, although this arrangement possesses a superior
ratio of lift to drag to that of the biplane or multiplane, the
great span necessary to obtain the wing area is impracticable.
It is quite obvious that to brace adequately a monoplane
structure of 100 ft. span or so, a very complex system would
be required, in addition to which the spars would essentially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
be of larger and heavier section. The biplane arrangement
can be used successfully for spans up to 100 ft., and, assuming
that the future commercial machine will necessitate still
greater wing area, it is a feasible supposition that the triplane,
or even quadruplane systems will be used. Certain modern
triplanes have a reputed excellent performance, the carrying
capacity and engine power being colossal. Against this we
have the fact that the advantage of the triplane system is
purely structural, as aerodynamically it is not nearly so
efficient as the biplane, and it is at this stage that the question
of the limiting size of aeroplanes is encountered. Various
tests, both in model form and full size, have shown that the
lift of the middle plane of the triplane system is greatly
inferior to that of the top or bottom planes, this being due to
the interference of the free air flow by the upper and lower
planes. This circumstance is an indication that the biplane
arrangement, viewed from the standpoints of modern design,
is the most economical form for future commercial use.</p>

<span class="subhead">FUSELAGE CONSTRUCTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> body, or fuselage as it is generally described, constitutes
the nucleus of the completed machine, and at the same time
offers the most interesting examples of constructional detail.
It may be as well to point out that the term “fuselage” is
ordinarily applicable to a body of a machine of the tractor
type; the short body of the average “pusher” or propeller
aeroplane is termed the “nacelle.”</p>

<p>The material chiefly used in the construction of this component
is wood, and there are but very few instances where
metal is used.</p>

<h3>Fuselage Types.</h3>

<p>The different types or methods of construction may be
classified in the following <span class="locked">order:—</span></p>

<p>1. Box-girder of four longerons or rails, with cross-struts
and wire bracing (<a href="#i_fig65">Fig. 65</a>).</p>

<figure id="i_fig65" class="figcenter">

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 65.</span>—Arrangement of fuselage members.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>2. Tail portion of longerons, struts and wiring; in the
front portion the wire bracing is dispensed with, being replaced
by diagonal wood bracing, to which is screwed either
three-ply or sheet aluminium alloy (<a href="#i_fig66">Fig. 66</a>).</p>

<p>3. In this case wire bracing is entirely dispensed with, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
four, and occasionally six, longitudinals being connected
together by cross struts or formers cut to the required shape,
the whole body being covered with three-ply.</p>

<p>4. Laminated or monocoque type, formed by layers of
wood and fabric, crossed alternately and glued together.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66.</span>—Arrangement of fuselage members.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Box-Girder Type.</h3>

<p>Dealing with each type in greater detail, and in order of
classification, the details and methods of manufacture of type
1 may be considered. The longerons are usually of ash or
hickory, although latterly silver spruce has come into use for
this purpose, this being due to the desire to reduce weight to
the absolute minimum.</p>

<p>In the opinion of the writer, a spruce longeron should be
of larger section than one of hard wood, for one or two reasons.
Spruce is a soft wood, and the outside fibres are far more apt
to get damaged by a fitting which has been bolted home with
too much pressure, also the corners may get rubbed or knocked
off, which all means a reduction in strength. The use of a
spruce longeron precludes any sharp bends in the contour of
the fuselage, as this wood does not lend itself to bending,
although it may be sprung to an easy curve. By disposing
joints in the longerons, it is possible to arrange the lengths
so that the bend is contained in one portion. This portion
can then be of laminated construction, <i>i.e.</i> it can be built up
of a number of layers glued together, and clamped to a block
of the required shape until the glue has set. In some cases
the longerons from the engine mounting to the rear cockpit,
where additional strength is necessary, are of ash, while aft of
that, to the stern post, spruce is the material.</p>

<figure id="i_fig67" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig067.png" width="1145" height="1246" style="width: 18em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span>—Longeron sections.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is usual, in this country at least, to spindle the rails to
one of the sections illustrated by <a href="#i_fig67">Fig. 67</a>, this spindling or
channelling running through from nose to stern post, or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
front portion, extending as far as the rear cockpit, is left solid,
the tail part only being spindled. This channelling is always
stopped at the intersection of the cross-struts with the rails,
to provide the abutment for the struts, and the extra material
to compensate for any holes necessary for the attachment of
the fitting. In the shaping of the rails longitudinally, two
methods are available: they may be tapered or gradually
diminished from the front to the stern post, or the overall
section may be parallel to a point somewhere in the neighbourhood
of the pilot’s seat, and from that point diminished
to the stern post. The first method is obsolete, as all the
fittings vary in size, which makes for undue complication as
well as increasing the number of jigs and dies necessary to
produce the stampings. The second method only partly
obviates this, and the only system which permits of the same
size fitting being used right through is that in which the rails
are of the same overall section throughout, but this is very
rarely used.</p>

<p>Another arrangement consists of keeping the rail of equal
thickness for approximately 10 ft. from the engine bearers,
and then diminishing in a series of steps to the stern post.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
By this method only three or four sizes of fittings are necessary.
Some fittings are not affected by the taper of the rails,
and are made the same size throughout, but in nearly every
case the attachment to the rails is accomplished either by
bolts or screws. The piercing of the longeron, particularly
when this is of spruce, is hardly commendable practice, and
certainly in view of the many forms of clip fittings in use
appears to be unnecessary. A point which apparently escapes
the notice of some designers, is the necessity of some allowance
being made for unfair stresses induced by landing shocks and
rough handling. There is a tendency to make the tail portion
separate from the front, the joint occurring just aft of the rear
cockpit, so that in the event of damage due to strains transmitted
by the tail skid, this portion can be detached and a
new portion substituted, which seems infinitely better than
dismantling the whole machine and returning the whole body
to the works or depôt. In the design of the body under consideration
due regard should be given to the necessity of
occasional replacement of a damaged rail. Some fittings afford
the utmost facility for this, while others render this procedure
a lengthy and difficult operation.</p>

<h3>Jointing of Longerons.</h3>

<p>A popular method of jointing longerons consists usually of
a plain butt joint, clipped with some form of steel tube socket,
or by fish-plates flanged to clip the edges of the longerons and
bolted through. A spliced joint is sometimes used when
timber is not procurable in any great length, this consisting
of an ordinary splice from 12 to 18 ins. long, glued and
riveted, and afterwards, when the joint is thoroughly set,
bound with tape soaked in glue and subsequently doped and
varnished. As this is a somewhat lengthy operation the
socket method predominates. In modern aeroplanes the size
of a longeron rarely exceeds 1½ ins. square, and it will therefore
be realized that this construction is all that is possible,
as, owing to the slightness of material, no advantage would
accrue from the employment of a joint of the halved or
scarfed variety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<h3>Diagonal Wood Bracing.</h3>

<p>A great deal of the foregoing applies to the second type,
so far as the longerons and tail portion are concerned. The
diagonal wood bracing is usually of spruce, and is, of course,
heavier than wiring. The aluminium or duralumin sheeting
has latterly given place to three-ply for the outside covering,
which may be ascribed to the saving in weight effected by its
use, as a square foot of 20 B.W.G. aluminium, which is the
general thickness for this purpose, weighs 8 ozs., while a
square foot of 3/32 in. birch three-ply weighs approximately
5 ozs. This gives a saving of 3 ozs. for every square foot of
surface covered, and moreover three-ply, properly glued and
screwed or copper, nailed to the framework, constitutes by far
the better stiffening medium. The disadvantages of this
method of construction are: (1) the difficulty of re-truing the
front portion should distortion occur; (2) erection is somewhat
involved; and (3) it is heavier than the first type, although
it affords a more solid mounting for the engine, with a
consequent reduction of vibration.</p>

<h3>Three-ply Fuselage.</h3>

<p>The third system is typical of the method adopted for the
series of German Albatross machines. There are few, if any,
examples of its use in this country, although prior to the war
a few constructors favoured its use, and one successful monoplane
of note was so built. The writer is acquainted with one
pioneer designer who very strongly believes in this form of
construction, and certain later developments in the use of
three-ply confirm this view. The advantages of this form
of construction are: (1) quickness of production; (2) great
strength in a vertical and horizontal direction; (3) the result
of the longeron being shot through would not endanger the
structure to the same extent as with a wire-braced system.
Against this must be balanced the fact that: (1) it entails a
considerable increase in weight; (2) is weak under a torsional
strain, such as that produced by the combined actions of
elevator and rudder; and (3) cannot be trued up in the event<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
of distortion. Examples of this system in pre-war machines
are afforded by the Martinsyde and Blackburn monoplanes,
although the framework in both cases was so formed as to
constitute a lattice girder. The tail portion of the Martinsyde
was lightened by cutting away diamond-shaped pieces from
each bay.</p>

<p>The formers of the Albatross are extremely simple. In
the fore part they are cut from three-ply, while at the rear
they are just simple frames composed of laths, reinforced
where the longerons occur by three-ply stiffeners. There are
six longerons, the two middle ones being fixed slightly more
than halfway up each side, which are really longitudinal
stringers to prevent the three-ply buckling between the points
of attachment.</p>

<h3>The Monocoque Type.</h3>

<p>The monocoque system originated in France, several constructors
having produced machines incorporating this feature.
The most successful machine produced on these lines was the
Deperdussin, and many will recall the excellent streamline
form of the machine exhibited at the 1913 Aero Show. These
bodies were built over formers of various sections, which were
removed when the glue joining the different layers had set.
The resultant shell, which was about four millimetres thick,
was then covered with fabric and varnished. Several factors
militate against its extensive adoption as a method. It is
rather costly, and does not seem to be suited to rapid production.
In addition, the attachment of such members as the
chassis, wings, and interplane struts, is more complicated.
It should be noted, however, that various modern machines
are similarly built. The Borel firm produced a machine with
monocoque body, this being composed of three-ply covering
on ribs running diagonally the length of the body, and
although this is not such a lengthy operation as the Dep.
system, it has not survived, unless one considers flying-boat
construction as its modern version. A slight variation of the
monocoque system is used for the bodies of some modern
aeroplanes. The framework consists of very small stringers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
arranged at various points on light formers cut to the fuselage
section. To this structure is applied two thicknesses of three-ply
in the form of strips about 3¼ ins. wide, each thickness
being disposed diagonally in opposite directions, as shown by
<a href="#i_fig68">Fig. 68</a>. This is covered with fabric, the total thickness being
no more than 1½ mm., and as this is made up of six layers of
wood and one of fabric, the fineness of the ply-wood will be
realized.</p>

<figure id="i_fig68" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig068.png" width="1075" height="1020" style="width: 17em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span>—Arrangement of three-ply bands in monocoque fuselage.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It should be noted that the ply-wood strips do not completely
encircle the formers, but are jointed at the top and
bottom, a light longeron being arranged at these points.</p>

<p>A detail which would appear to be of great utility at the
present time is the arrangement wherein the nose of the body
containing the engine and accessories is a separate unit, and
in the event of engine breakdown can be detached and another
substituted.</p>

<h3>Fuselage Contours.</h3>

<p>In the design of the contour of the fuselage the type of
the motor used is the determining influence. With the vertical
“in line” engine, it is possible to design a slim narrow body,
while a rotary or radial engine necessitates an increase in
width, which also means increased air resistance. With the
Vee type engine, the popular practice is to allow the tops of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
the cylinders to project through the cowling, which permits
of a narrower body than if the width of the body equalled the
overall width of the engine. Where a rotary engine is employed
and the mounting is of the overhung type, the width
of the fuselage may be reduced by allowing the engine to
project over the sides, and the cowling carried on an arrangement
of formers and stringers, which gradually merges into
the main structure, as in <a href="#i_fig69">Fig. 69</a>. It is apparent that the line
of the body and that of the fairing should converge as gradually
as possible, as, should this be at all abrupt, there is a
distinct possibility that the air flow will take the course
indicated in <a href="#i_fig70">Fig. 70</a>, resulting in a dead air region and
inefficiency.</p>

<figure id="i_fig69" class="figcenter">

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span>—Fuselage outline.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It may be taken generally that the wider the body the
greater the weight, for the struts have not only to be made
longer but also of greater overall section. The practice in
this country is to keep the longerons parallel to the centre line
on plan, as far as the rear cockpit, tapering from that point
to the stern post in a straight or slightly curved line, as
<a href="#i_fig71">Fig. 71</a>.</p>

<figure id="i_fig71" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig071.png" width="1127" height="195" style="width: 18em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.</span>—Fuselage outline.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This simplifies the fittings, the sockets for the centre plane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
struts are in line, and the different lengths of fuselage struts
necessary reduced to a minimum.</p>

<figure id="i_fig72" class="figcenter">

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span>—Fuselage outline.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The plan outline of several German machines is shown
diagrammatically by <a href="#i_fig72">Fig. 72</a>. It will be seen that from the
nose the body gradually widens out until the maximum width,
generally in the vicinity of the front seat, is reached, from
where it tapers to the tail. This shape appears to satisfy
aero-dynamic requirements more closely than either of the
foregoing examples; but in practice the difference is not
appreciable, and in any case the reduction of head resistance
does not compensate for the additional work.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.</span>—Fuselage outline.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In side elevation the general practice, with exceptions, is
to arrange the top longerons parallel to the line of thrust, <i>i.e.</i>
the axis of the motor, as in <a href="#i_fig73">Fig. 73</a>. This simplifies erection
and affords a convenient datum line for truing up.</p>

<figure id="i_fig75" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig075.png" width="1185" height="161" style="width: 19em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75.</span>—Fuselage outline.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the German Rumpler and early Albatross biplanes, the
upper longerons are curved, as in <a href="#i_fig74">Fig. 74</a>, but in the most
recent versions of the Albatross they are level with the line of
thrust. <a href="#i_fig75">Fig. 75</a> illustrates an arrangement where the top rails,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
from a point some distance along, slope down to the nose. By
this method the body weight is kept as low as possible and the
engine and accessories rendered more accessible. Although
it is usual to terminate the body in a vertical knife-edge,
formed generally by the rudder post, another arrangement,
typical of the Morane monoplane, finishes in a horizontal
edge. The German Fokker, obviously inspired by the French
Morane, and the Albatross DI, are similarly terminated. This
system of tapering to a horizontal knife-edge is not considered
the best arrangement from a strength point of view,
the flat angle of the bracing wires permitting a certain amount
of movement, eventually resulting in slackness and loss of
alignment.</p>

<span class="subhead">FUSELAGE FITTINGS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> design and type of fitting employed for connecting the
longerons, cross and vertical struts of the fuselage, varies
greatly, being usually one of the distinctive constructional
details of a machine. This position renders uniformity of
practice a comparatively unattainable quantity, which, in view
of present requirements, and the absolute need of rapidity of
output (which must commence as soon as possible after a
successful design is produced), can only be considered as
regrettable. This diversity of design is mainly the result of
the desire for originality of each individual designer, and however
commendable from this standpoint, is a position which is
almost certain to disappear with the progress of the industry.
Take as a hypothesis the case of, say, ten makes of scouting
biplanes in use, each with approximately the same arrangement
of longerons and struts, and with a similar overall size
of fuselage. Each of these machines will incorporate a
different fuselage clip, which means that somewhere highly
skilled labour is being unnecessarily expended in the making
of jigs and press tools, whereas a suitably standardized clip
for all scout machines of certain dimensions would involve the
making of one set of press and bending tools only for the
machines of the one type built. Another aspect, quite as important,
is the simplification of the supply of spares. Acceleration
of aircraft output, if achieved only through the medium
of small part production, is one of the most important contributary
factors towards ultimate success in the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<h3>Types in Use.</h3>

<p>The sketches, explained in detail hereafter, are illustrative
of some of the many systems in use, and taken collectively
fall under two categories: (1) those in which attachment to
the longeron involves drilling, and (2) those in which the
fitting clips or encircles the longeron, friction only keeping it
in position. The first method permits of a clip of comparatively
simple design, but it has the serious disadvantage
of weakening the material, and assuming the longeron section
is sufficient to account for this, then clearly a fitting which is
attached without the use of bolts would allow a reduction in
the size of a longeron (which means a saving in weight) without
depreciating the factor of safety. In the second method
the attachment is usually accomplished by the pressure of
bolts, with practically no weakening effect; but in this case the
disadvantage lies in the fact that at each point of attachment
a differently dimensioned clip will be necessary, this being
due, as explained in the previous chapter, to the longeron
tapering towards the stern post. (A method of reducing the
number of different clips by suitably shaping the longeron
was also dealt with.) It is evident that most fittings must
inevitably form a compromise between the demands of production
and design, although it must be admitted that in some
cases the fittings collectively very successfully evade the
requirements of both.</p>

<figure id="i_fig76" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig076.png" width="1172" height="1044" style="width: 19em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 76.</span>—Fuselage fitting.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The clip indicated by <a href="#i_fig76">Fig. 76</a> is the particular form of
construction associated with the various versions of the Bleriot
monoplane, and favoured by the early pioneers generally. It
was retained in the Bleriot construction until some time after
the outbreak of the war—as a matter of fact, until the type was
deleted for war purposes.</p>

<p>It is composed, as will be seen from the sketch, of simply
two U-bolts, the attachment to the longeron involving the
drilling of four holes, which constitutes the chief objection to
this particular form of clip, and has been the subject of
criticism from the time of its first appearance as an aircraft
detail. The struts are slotted over the bolt, and although this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
does not conform to the best principles, it is simple, and may
have been sufficient for a lightly loaded machine. A point
about this clip, which undoubtedly was the cause of its
popularity amongst the pioneers, with whom economy was an
evil necessity, is that the wires can be strained or tensioned
by an adjustment of the nuts on the longerons, <span class="locked">thus rendering</span></p>

<figure id="i_fig77" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig077.png" width="1172" height="1084" style="width: 19em;" alt=" ">

</figure>

<p class="in0">turnbuckles unnecessary. <a href="#i_fig77">Fig. 77</a> shows the form of clip used
on the Hanriot monoplanes, and is a good example of the class
of fitting bent up from sheet metal. This is usually made to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
be slightly smaller than the longeron, the pressure resulting
from the tightening of the bolts on the ends forming the cross-bracing
lug, keeping it in place. The defect of this arrangement
is that any slight shrinkage of the longeron will permit
movement, and for this reason provision should be made for
the subsequent adjustment of the bolts. The struts are taken
by the lugs punched up from the body of the clip. This leaves
very little material to resist the tension of the bracing wires
or tierods, but a modification of this clip surmounts this
difficulty.</p>

<figure id="i_fig78" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig078.png" width="1207" height="630" style="width: 19em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 78.</span>—Fuselage fitting.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A similar clip is used by the German Aviatik firm, but it
is certainly inferior owing to the very poor connection of the
struts. Instead of the four lugs gripping the sides of the
struts, they are punched up to form a square or tenon, over
which the cross-struts are mortised. In any case it would not
satisfy the standards maintained by our leading constructors,
and certainly not the technical advisers to the Air Board.
The clip indicated in <a href="#i_fig78">Fig. 78</a> does not encircle the longeron,
but abuts against the two inner sides of the longeron only.
The body of this clip is a stamping, bent to a right angle, to
which the square sockets for the struts are welded. Attachment
to the longeron is effected by an eyebolt, which passes
diagonally through it, this also providing the anchorage for
the cross-bracing wire. A form of this clip has been used on
a certain make of machine for a considerable period, so that
it has advantages that are not readily apparent. One outstanding
defect is existent in that the pull of the wires would
tend to lift the socket on the side opposite to the eye bolt, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
this in turn would cause distortion of the struts. A connection
favoured by an American firm is shown by <a href="#i_fig79">Fig. 79</a>, and
possesses the merit of extreme simplicity. The longerons are
not drilled, the attachment being through the agency of an
L bolt, which also provides the anchorage for the cross-bracing
wire. To prevent movement the clip is additionally fixed to
the longeron by wood screws.</p>

fastened in place by steel bushes, which are driven through in
the form of steel tube, and expanded and burred round the
socket, at the same time forming the anchorage for the wires.
This system has been used in the construction of a fast scout
of comparatively recent origin, but it embodies the same
defects as the Bleriot clip, <i>i.e.</i> four holes are needed in the
longeron for every joint; but it has the advantage over the
latter in that a better terminal is provided for the struts.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fig81">Fig. 81</a> indicates the arrangement on the German L.V.G.
(Luft-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft) fighting biplane. This is an
aluminium alloy casting, fastened to the longeron by screws,
and as it is not affected by the taper of the longeron, all
the fittings, or at any rate, those in the tail portion, can be of
the same dimensions. A point which is often overlooked when
using a fitting of this type is that any strain on the wires is
transmitted to the longeron by the fastening screws only, or,
in other words, the tendency of the wires when tensioned to
pull the fitting from the longeron is resisted by the screws
only. This does not impress one as being well suited to
perform the functions demanded of the average joint, and
about the only detail upon which its existence is justified is
its ease of production. In the writer’s opinion the clip, <a href="#i_fig82">Fig.
82</a>, is by far the finest connection yet devised, and one that
should be standardized. Its attachment is accomplished without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
objectionable drilling; it provides an excellent housing for
the cross-struts; can be tightened up should shrinkage occur
in the longerons; and can be produced at an absurdly low
figure. This clip has been used on machines which have
accomplished some meteoric performances during the war,
and, moreover, was designed and in use a considerable period
before the war.</p>

<p>The clip, <a href="#i_fig83">Fig. 83</a>, is simple and quite easily manufactured,
being stamped out of sheet metal, and bent up to shape. The
lugs forming the anchorage for the wires would have a tendency
to straighten out at the bends; but the amount of this,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
whether serious or otherwise, in the absence of actual experience,
is largely conjectural. However, a fitting of this kind
was used in the construction of the nacelle of a seaplane
exhibited at Olympia in 1914.</p>

<h3>Steel Tube Fuselage Construction.</h3>

  <p><span class="smcap">Fig. 84.</span>—Welded joint in steel tube fuselage.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In certain isolated instances, the fuselage is built up of
steel tubing, and on one machine of recent design the joints
throughout are effected by welding: a detail of the attachment
of the vertical and cross struts to the longerons is shown by
<a href="#i_fig84">Fig. 84</a>. It will be noticed that a small quadrant-shaped piece
of tube or rod is welded to the struts, and from this are taken
the bracing wires. As the welded joints impart a certain
rigidity to the structure, the fact that the wires are exerting
a side pull on the struts may be of little consequence, although
this method could hardly be used in conjunction with the
fuselage construction of average English machines. A rather
unusual feature may be noticed in the attachment of the
bracing wires, which are not finished off with the orthodox
wire ferrule, but are arranged as a loop, the turnbuckle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
forming the anchorage for the two ends. The trend of design
in this country seems to incline towards the clip stamped out
from sheet steel and bent up. This class of fitting can be
produced accurately and quickly, and, in the writer’s opinion,
is by far the best manufacturing proposition. Aluminium
castings are quite obsolete, and the built-up fitting, involving
welding or brazing, does not seem greatly in vogue.</p>

<span class="subhead">UNDERCARRIAGE TYPES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> present chapter deals with the general arrangement of
the different types of undercarriages, as distinct from the
details of construction. The principles of design embodied in
the undercarriage are necessarily a compromise, this position
being due to the fact that its construction has to be considered
from two distinctly opposed view-points, and undue attention
to the requirements of either does not produce the best results.
Thus, on the one hand, we have the desirability of great
strength to withstand landings on very rough ground, ploughed
fields, and the like; and on the other hand, we have the considerations
of aerodynamical efficiency in flight, which, taken
to one extreme, would be best satisfied if the undercarriage
did not exist, and at most calls for a system in which the head
resistance is brought to an irreducible minimum. By the
ordinary process of evolution the agglomeration of ideas
existing in the early days of flying with regard to the most
suitable form of landing gear, have given place to something
which, for machines of modern attainments, approaches
finality. This has resulted from improvements along the line
of (1) simplification of general design, (2) the reduction of
head resistance and weight without a consequent diminution
in its powers as an alighting gear. A better impression of the
distinguishing points of the various types will be gathered if we
consider the desiderata of an ideal undercarriage.</p>

<h3>Principles of Design.</h3>

<p>One of the most important points is that rolling shocks
should be completely absorbed, and the least possible strain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
transmitted to the fuselage or main structure, this calling for
a good system of wheel suspension. It must be capable of
standing the considerable strains sustained in alighting, not
the least of which are those attendant upon landing in a side
wind; should offer the least possible head resistance, while
the weight must be reduced to a minimum. Cross-country
flying, which more often than not means “getting off” in a
restricted space, requires that the machine shall attain flying
speed in the shortest time, and conversely in alighting the
machine should come to rest in the quickest time. Innumerable
smashes have been caused after a perfectly good landing
by failure to pull up before a hedge, fence, or ditch. These
are the main principles involved, and at least they indicate
how and why the undercarriage is necessarily a compromise.</p>

<figure id="i_fig85" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig085.png" width="1132" height="482" style="width: 18em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 85.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is clear that in landing the speed of the machine relative
to the ground should be as low as possible, without developing
into the operation generally known as “pancaking,” or stalling,
and the usual method of accomplishing this is to bring the
machine into the wind, which, if of a moderate velocity,
materially reduces the speed relative to the earth. In ordinary
circumstances, landing would be accomplished by gradually
increasing the angle of incidence until the maximum, or angle
of no lift, is reached, which is practically stalling point. To
satisfy this consideration, the heights of the main rolling
wheels and tail skid should be arranged to allow the wings to
lie at an angle a little in excess of this. With modern wing
sections the angle of maximum lift is between 14° and 16°, so
that the angle of 18°, as shown in <a href="#i_fig85">Fig. 85</a>, is usually sufficient.
This has additional value in restricting the length of run after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
contact with the ground, the wings acting as air-brakes. It
will be realized that reduction in height of the undercarriage,
desirable as it is from the aspect of head resistance, cannot be
carried beyond a certain point without the sacrifice to some
extent of the foregoing qualities. So far we have taken the
principles of design as affecting the disposition of the undercarriage
members in a longitudinal direction, but, of course,
there are several details to be considered in its arrangement
laterally. A fundamental point is that the track of the wheels,
<i>i.e.</i> the distance, centre to centre, should be of ample width,
but several constructional difficulties tend to restrict this to
certain limits. Where the undercarriage is of the type in
which the main rolling wheels are mounted on a single axle,
it is clear that the wheel base is limited to the greatest length
the steel or duralumin tube can be used without buckling
under landing shocks. If this is to be exceeded a bigger
diameter tube of thicker gauge will be necessary, and this
means additional weight. Again, the fuselage width for the
tractor machines now in vogue does not greatly exceed 3 ft.,
being more usually under that figure, so that a very wide
base would mean raking the struts at a flat angle, which would
therefore require to be made of larger section than would be
the case if the wheel base was narrower; or, if the same
section strut is used, the strength is reduced. A wide wheel
base therefore means an undesirable increase in weight and
resistance. To make up for the deficiencies of the almost unavoidable
narrow wheel base, it is usual to make use of the wing
tips by fitting skids of malacca cane or laminated ash, which
are brought into action when the machine is excessively canted
over sideways. At one time the wing tips were almost invariably
used to assist the undercarriage, the wing tips of the
Nieuport monoplane being specially constructed for the purpose,
and no skids were fitted. Earlier still the R.E.P. monoplane
had only one central rolling wheel, a smaller wheel being
attached to each wing tip. The wing tip wheels of the Cody
biplane performed similar functions, although these were used
in conjunction with two main wheels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<h3>Undercarriage Types.</h3>

<p>The type of landing gear in use to-day does not vary in
principle to any great extent, the differences usually occurring
in the choice of material, the system being that usually known
as the Vee type, from the fact that viewed in side elevation,
the struts form a V. While this type has much to commend
it from the points of low head resistance and great strength for
weight, there are other systems, some of which have been tried-out,
while others still exist, incorporating features designed
for some specific purpose. Of these the Farman type is an
example of a landing gear designed for the requirements of
school work, consisting of two long ash skids, which, extended
from the rear end of the nacelle, being gradually bent upwards
to carry the front elevator. This was the arrangement on the
“Longhorn” machine, but on the “Shorthorn,” <span class="locked">produced at</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 86.</span>—Side view of Farman landing gear.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="in0">a later date, the skids, as shown by <a href="#i_fig86">Fig. 86</a>, terminated in
short bends. Each skid carried a pair of rolling wheels,
attached to a short axle, this being bound to the skids by
rubber bands. The wheel base being almost 9 ft., this type
gave excellent results. In the case of big machines, where it
is desired to keep the load on the tail skid as light as possible,
three wheels are sometimes used, two main rolling wheels and
a light pilot wheel in the front. This enables the main rolling
wheels to be placed under the centre of gravity, the pilot
wheel preventing the consequent tendency to pitch forward
when rolling. A further development of this system dispenses
with the tail skid, two main wheels being placed under the
centre of gravity, and two smaller wheels a little <span class="locked">forward of</span></p>

<p class="in0">the propeller, as in <a href="#i_fig87">Fig. 87</a>. The skids were sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
continued back behind the rear struts, and saw-kerfed to increase
the resiliency. The base of support was formed by the rear
wheels and the ends of the skids, the machine being pulled on
to the front wheels by the thrust of the propeller. The short
wheel base is bad for rolling on bumpy ground, and frequent
skid replacements are necessary with this system. A similar
type with no tail skid has the wheels disposed forward of the
C.G., while a single central skid, connected to the <span class="locked">fuselage by</span></p>

</figure>

<p class="in0">a series of V struts, replaced the double skids, as in <a href="#i_fig88">Fig. 88</a>.
This type was used on the original Nieuport monoplane, and
with minor modifications on the Avro 80 h.p. Gnome tractor
biplane. Its chief advantage is low head resistance, but unfortunately
with this system a narrow wheel base, with the
attendant defects, is inevitable. A very distinctive system
was that favoured by Bleriot, and used with minor alterations
on all the Bleriot monoplanes. This is shown, diagrammatically,
in side elevation, by <a href="#i_fig89">Fig. 89</a>, and was unusual in
that the wheels were arranged to swivel, this being an attempt
to counteract the side strains set up when landing in a side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
wind. Although in the hands of some of our most famous
exhibition pilots this has functioned excellently, it is complicated
and somewhat heavy.</p>

</figure>

<h3>Recent Developments.</h3>

<p>During the last three years the vital necessity of speed and
climb, and more speed and climb, has resulted in the gradual
elimination of skids, struts, and wires, until to-day the chassis
for machines of average dimensions is almost invariably the
V type (<a href="#i_fig90">Fig. 90</a>). The wheels are placed about a foot in front
of the C.G., as, owing to the absence of any forward skid, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
other provision exists to counteract the tendency to pitch over.
In the actual construction of the Vee undercarriage, some
diversity of practice exists with regard to the material chosen.
In some cases the struts forming the Vees are constructed of
a streamline section steel tubing, in others round tubing, the
streamline section being obtained by a wooden fairing bound
on, while a number of constructors use wood for the struts.</p>

<span class="subhead">UNDERCARRIAGE DETAILS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> details of construction associated with the undercarriage
are those concerned with the forming of the struts and main
members, and the suspension of the axle. As noted in the
previous chapter the Vee undercarriage is greatly in favour at
present, but the fact that with this type no forward support
exists to prevent pitching over when obstructions are met in
rolling, will almost certainly result in some arrangement of
wheels and skids for the touring machines of the post-war
period. Machines are now designed for air performance pure
and simple, so that an undercarriage of the simple Vee type is
all that is permissible; but in the post-war machine general
utility will be the desideratum sought for by designers. At
one time the majority of the undercarriage arrangements
incorporated one or more skids. The material most suited for
this purpose is hickory, although some designers prefer ash,
steamed to the desired curve, and generally channelled out
between the points of intersection of the struts, fittings, etc.,
in a similar manner to longerons and wing spars.</p>

<p>Where the bend is sharp, and therefore difficult to obtain
by steaming, it is usual to form the skid from a number of
strips, or laminations, glued together. Quite a good method
of stream-lining the curved toe of the skid is shown by <a href="#i_fig91">Fig. 91</a>,
consisting of a spruce block attached to the skid by screws,
and it has additional value in ensuring permanency of curve.
Where the design is such that the rear end of the skid performs
the functions of a tail skid it is saw-kerfed, as in <a href="#i_fig92">Fig. 92</a>,
the laminations so formed being stepped back, and the bottom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
layer shod with a plate, or claw fitting, acting as a brake, and
also preventing wear produced by contact with the ground.
At one time this constituted popular practice, but it is a matter
of some difficulty to prevent the saw-cuts from developing
into fractures. As a matter of fact, on one type of machine
replacements were so frequent that eventually the skid end
was left solid.</p>

<h3>Methods of Suspension.</h3>

<p>In the preliminaries of design referred to in the last
chapter, it was observed that the action of rolling and alighting
called for a good system of suspension and shock absorption,
and this is accomplished on modern machines by binding the
axle to the main members of the structure with either rubber
cord (this being a number of strands of rubber about 1/16 in.
square, compressed and bound together with a woven twine
casing) or plain rubber rings. The latter are more or less
obsolescent, at least in this country, the reason being found in
the better lasting qualities of the cord, which will also withstand
a much higher ultimate stress, the fabric covering contributing
largely to this. In a number of cases, and generally
for heavy machines, steel helical springs are fitted. Various
attempts right from the beginning of successful flight have
been made to utilize steel springs for suspension, but hitherto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
very few machines have successfully incorporated them, and
but a brief examination will show that their use on machines
of the average modern type is attended with some unsatisfactory
features. Firstly, they are much heavier than rubber,
but this in itself is no great disadvantage, as ease of attachment
probably compensates for this; but what is of moment
is the fact that steel springs are not nearly so efficient <em>shock-absorbers</em>
as the rubber variety, while even the efficiency of the
latter is capable of considerable improvement. If we take the
case of a machine rolling over bumpy ground, all that is
required of the suspension is that the wheel movement over
the inequalities shall not be transmitted to the whole machine.
So far both steel springs and rubber cord satisfy these conditions,
but in the operation of alighting the machine not
infrequently strikes the ground with some force, sometimes
the result of gusts or pancaking. With steel springs, and to a
lesser degree those of rubber, the energy of landing is not
absorbed, but is stored up, being given out again in the form
of a rebound. With rubber, elongation and its consequent
depreciation of ultimate tensile strength prevents any energy
of moment being returned to the aeroplane, which is why, for
light machines of modern design, say, up to 2500 lbs. total
weight, rubber is the better material. Steel springs being
deficient in the power to damp out shocks, it becomes
necessary to use these in conjunction with some other
medium possessing this quality, and one of the most suitable
arrangements extant is that known as the oleo-pneumatic
gear, consisting of a combination of helical coil spring and
oil plunger. It is usual to arrange the main compression
members in two halves, the upper half forming a piston, and
the lower, attached to the wheels, constituting the cylinder,
is filled with oil. The weight of the machine is taken
normally during rolling by the helical spring, wound round
the upper half of the telescopic tube. Excessive shocks cause
the oil to be forced through a spring valve, adjusted to open
at a certain pressure, into the upper half, a back-pressure
valve enabling the oil to gradually return to the cylinder.
The Breguet biplane, a pre-war machine of original design,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
embodied in the undercarriage arrangement a system analogous
to the foregoing.</p>

<h3>Shock Absorbing Effect of Tyres.</h3>

<p>The assistance rendered by tyres of large diameter must
not be overlooked. The merits of the large tread are quite
well known in the sphere of the motor-car, and they are no
less beneficial to the aeroplane. It is of interest to record
that a pre-war racing machine had no other suspension and
shock-absorbing medium than that provided by the very
large tyres fitted to the wheels, the axle being fixed rigidly to
the undercarriage struts. A similar arrangement existed on a
machine of much more recent date. One does not advocate
this system, as it can be of very little use for rough ground,
the instance being cited to emphasize the assistance so
rendered to the ordinary type of suspension.</p>

<h3>Connections.</h3>

<p>Various methods exist for connecting the rubber to the
main members, a typical arrangement with the <span class="locked">Vee undercarriage</span></p>

rubber bands compared with the rubber cable.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 98.</span>—Axle fairing.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is now the practice to streamline the compression tubes
between the vees of the undercarriage with a fairing of aluminium
or three-ply. This is so arranged that in flight the
axle lies in a slot formed in the fairing, which appreciably
reduces head resistance. A typical arrangement is indicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
by <a href="#i_fig98">Fig. 98</a>. The axle is usually formed of steel or duralumin
tube, and in the majority of undercarriage arrangements is
divided and hinged in the centre, a wire or wires from this
point to the fuselage accounting for any strain. Duralumin
tube is especially suited for this item, as a much stiffer axle is
possible for a given weight, although, unfortunately, this is
slightly discounted by the fact that duralumin does not form a
good bearing surface for the wheel hubs, and it therefore
becomes necessary to fit either sleeves or stub-axles of steel.</p>

<h3>Undercarriage Brakes.</h3>

<p>Additional means for restricting the length of travel after
contact with the ground is sometimes found in the employment
of brakes of various types. A very simple and widely
used arrangement is to terminate the tail skid in a claw fitting,
as <a href="#i_fig99">Fig. 99</a>, so that in alighting the tail is shoved hard
down, bringing the skid into contact with the ground. The
disadvantage is that undesirable strains may be carried to the
fuselage members.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 99.</span>—Tail skid with claw fitting.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another version recently patented is to construct small
planes to conform to the wing curve, and hinged so that by a
system of wires and pulleys, actuated from the pilot’s seat,
they could be adjusted to offer a normal surface to the direction
of flight. The efficiency of this arrangement at low
speeds is not very great, moreover a landing with the wind
renders them quite useless. The best form of brake is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
undoubtedly one acting direct on the main wheels, either of
the rim or band type, a good example of the latter being the
system used on the 70 h.p. Bristol biplane. Closely allied to
the question of brakes is that of steering, and the requirements
of this latter item are fairly well satisfied by pivoting
the tail skid and working it in conjunction with the rudder
from the foot-bar or wheel.</p>

<h3>Housing of Undercarriage during Flight.</h3>

<p>Numerous suggestions, ideas, and patents exist, having as
their object the housing of the undercarriage in the fuselage
during flight, with a resultant reduction in resistance; and
excellent as the principle is, its practical application is difficult
of achievement—at least, for machines of the present. In
flight the undercarriage is a useless encumbrance, adding
weight and head resistance, so that an arrangement whereby
this component could be folded into the main structure would
apparently effect a saving in resistance. This would mean
that the fuselage would be of larger cross-sectional area, the
natural sequence being extra weight and resistance. It does
not appear that the saving effected in resistance, when the
undercarriage is folded during flight, would account for the
additional weight of the operating mechanism and the increased
head resistance of the fuselage, so that altogether the
advantages of any so-called disappearing landing gear are very
much more apparent than real. There is also the very great
possibility of the undercarriage folding up or disappearing
when it would be least required to do so. In the construction
of the problematic air-liners of the future it may be possible
to economically effect the housing of the undercarriage.</p>

<span class="subhead">CONTROL SYSTEMS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> mechanism by which the aeroplane is controlled in flight
forms the connecting link between the pilot and machine, and
constitutes a vitally important and somewhat vulnerable item
of the complete structure.</p>

<h3>Main Principles.</h3>

<p>The control of all modern aeroplanes is effected in a lateral
direction by small planes hinged to the rear spar of the outer
ends of the wings, and known as “ailerons”; in a longitudinal
or “fore-and-aft” direction by the elevator planes;
and for steering by the rudder. Although these functions are
alluded to separately, they are more often than not combined
in their actions. The correct proportion of the controlling
surfaces is an important factor in determining the ease or
otherwise with which a machine can be handled in flight, and
faults in this direction are responsible for the terms “heavy”
or “stiff” on the controls being applied to a machine. The
use of subsidiary flaps or ailerons for lateral control is a comparatively
modern innovation. At one time it was usual to
warp the entire plane, or in some cases the outer section only,
and although the principle is the same—that of forming a
negative or positive surface to the line of flight—structural
considerations are wholly in favour of ailerons. With warping,
the whole plane is subjected to continuous torsional
movement, and to obtain this some of the trussing wires have
necessarily to be arranged as control wires, the result being
that the plane curvature loses its uniformity, and the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
girder system of the planes is less efficient under load than if
the wires were permanently fixed; and the latter item is only
possible with aileron control. Although it is usual to attach
ailerons to both top and bottom planes of a biplane, there are
occasions when sufficient control can be obtained with ailerons
to the upper plane only, usually when the span of this plane
is greater than that of the bottom.</p>

<h3>Control by Inherent Stability.</h3>

<p>With machines of the inherent stability class the lateral
control is effected by additional means, the planes being
designed to automatically right the effects of gusts. This
element of inherent stability is obtained by suitably grading
the camber and incidence of the wings, until at the wing tips
the chord of the plane section forms a negative angle to the
line of flight. Although this arrangement is undoubtedly of
value, especially for the touring machine of moderate power,
its chief fault lies in the relatively slow righting movements,
which, although of no great consequence at a reasonable altitude,
becomes a source of danger when alighting, and certainly
entail the use of ailerons, or warp, to counteract it.
The type was well exemplified in this country by the Handley-Page
monoplane and biplane, while in Germany it achieved
great popularity, surviving in some makes until the latter part
of 1916. In the matter of control-surface design it is interesting
to note the contrast between the preferences of English
and German designers. In almost all German machines the
ailerons, elevators, and rudder are balanced, <i>i.e.</i> surface is disposed
each side of the hinge-axis, this applying to the small
Albatross scouts and to the large machines of the Gotha class;
while in this country few examples of this practice occur.
The reason for the balancing of controls lies in the desire to
reduce the manual strain on the pilot to a minimum; and it
appears that with large machines balanced surfaces will be
imperative. Several automatic controls have been produced,
the most notable perhaps being the Sperry gyroscopic, this
being a combination of servo-motor and gyroscope. This
apparatus has been well tried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>So far as the arrangement of the control surfaces is concerned,
little variation occurs, which condition has obtained
from the early days of aviation, but the mechanism governing
or directing these movements varied at one time considerably,
and although in this country one type of control is used, there
are still instances of the use of widely different systems. In
former days the practice of individual makers fitting different
controls resulted in some arrangements being in exact contradistinction
to others, which not infrequently meant, to a
pilot taking on a new type, the unlearning of a great deal
which practice had rendered instinctive.</p>

<h3>The Instinctive Principle.</h3>

<p>All modern controls are based on the instinctive principle,
<i>i.e.</i> the movements of the control lever coincide in direction
with the promptings of natural instinct. Thus, to change the
course of a machine flying level into an upward one, the
column is pulled towards the pilot, and for descent, the reverse,
while to correct a bank, the column is moved in a direction
opposed to that of the bank. For steering, a foot-bar is
employed, so arranged that for a turn to the left the left foot
is pushed forward, and the reverse for a right turn. On one
well known machine of former days, the foot-bar actuated the
lateral control, which is sufficient indication of the great
diversity of opinion then existing.</p>

<h3>Vertical Column Control.</h3>

<figure id="i_fig100" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig100.png" width="1845" height="1185" style="width: 29em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 100.</span>—Arrangement of vertical column control.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A typical control of the immensely popular “joy-stick”
type is shown by <a href="#i_fig100">Fig. 100</a>. This consists of a vertical column
pivoted through the medium of a fork-joint to a rocking shaft.
The elevator wires are taken round pulleys mounted under
the seat, and the aileron wires from a form of bell-crank,
flanged and welded to the steel tube. A disadvantage with
this system, in addition to the complication of the wires, is
that lateral movement also affects the elevator, although the
extent of this is of no great moment. It is obvious, although
somewhat paradoxical, that if the elevator is to be depressed
by a forward movement of the column, the control wires will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
required to be crossed, <i>i.e.</i> the wire running from the base of
the tube to the pulleys will be attached to the arm on the top
side of the elevator, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>. On single-seater machines
it is sometimes necessary for the pilot to have both hands free
of the controls, so that it becomes necessary to install some
form of locking device for the elevator control, there being
many simple ways of accomplishing this. The locking of the
control lever fixes the flight path of the machine, but, of
course, lateral equilibrium can be maintained by movements of
the lever sideways, and steering by the rudder bar. The
German machines of the Fokker and Albatross types are both
fitted with the single lever control with a locking arrangement.
Another method which achieves the same purpose consists of
bracing the lever in a normal flying position, with rubber
cable or coil springs anchored to various parts of the fuselage,
and although this permits of movement, the control column
always tends to return to the normal position.</p>

<h3>Wheel Controls.</h3>

<figure id="i_fig101" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig101.png" width="1883" height="1584" style="width: 30em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 101.</span>—Arrangement of wheel control.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While the “joy-stick” type of control is greatly in favour,
there are various forms of wheel control in use. American
machines are almost entirely fitted with wheel controls, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
all things considered, it appears that modern practice is evenly
divided between the two types. The sequence of movements
of the wheel type may be varied in a number of ways, the
general arrangement shown by <a href="#i_fig101">Fig. 101</a> being typical of an
average system. In this case the hand-wheel is mounted on
a central column, which in turn is rigidly fixed by some form
of Tee joint to a transverse rocking shaft. A sprocket attached
to the wheel centre engages with a short length of chain,
which connects to the aileron control, while the elevator wires
are connected to short tillers, arranged to work on the outer
side of the fuselage. With this system the hand-wheel is
rotated for the aileron movements, a fore-and-aft rocking
motion for the elevation, and the rudder is actuated by an
outward movement, with either foot on the rudder bar. A
development designated “three in one” embodies all these
movements in the wheel column, which in this case is pivoted
at its base: a to-and-fro motion in the column for the elevators,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
sideways for the ailerons, while the rudder control is effected
by the rotation of the wheel. This system is fitted to a number
of American machines, but it is a moot point whether the
rotation of the wheel for warping or steering is quite such an
instinctive action, as the sideways movement of the lever
combined with the movements of the foot on the rudder-bar;
in any case, there is just a suspicion of complication in its
working which is undesirable, that is, for machines intended
for popular use.</p>

<h3>The “Dep” Control.</h3>

<figure id="i_fig102" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig102.png" width="1107" height="1316" style="width: 18em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 102.</span>—“Dep” type control.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The type of control used on the Deperdussin monoplanes
of 1910 and onwards has survived until the present day, and
forms a distinctive arrangement. Its chief attribute is that,
compared with other systems, much greater room and freedom
is afforded the pilot, which is evident by a consideration of the
diagrammatic sketch, <a href="#i_fig102">Fig. 102</a>. The inverted U-shaped lever
is composed of either ash, bent to shape, or steel, or duralumin
tube, the general system of its working being the same as the
wheel control shown by <a href="#i_fig101">Fig. 101</a>. Incidentally, passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
reference may be made to the fact that the usual close
proximity of the compass to the controls precludes the use of
steel in any great quantity for the construction of the lever,
as the various movements adversely affect the compass
readings.</p>

<h3>The Wright System.</h3>

<p>Another variant of the wheel control is instanced by the
Wright system, this consisting of a general lay out similar to
that shown by <a href="#i_fig101">Fig. 101</a>, but no rudder-bar is fitted. The
rudder control is provided by a small lever, mounted concentric
with the wheel, the latter carrying a rigidly attached
sprocket. The hand-lever is also connected to a sprocket, this
running free on the wheel shaft, so that by gripping both
hand-lever and wheel it is possible to operate the ailerons
and rudder simultaneously, this action being a characteristic
feature of all the Wright productions. Although there are
many types of control in use, those described in the foregoing
chapter are illustrative of general practice.</p>

<span class="subhead">WIRES AND CONNECTIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> all aeroplanes the question of wires and the terminal connections
associated therewith is a matter of some importance,
and while this may vary in degree, there is little doubt that
the efficiency of modern wiring systems is largely responsible
for the structural efficiency of the aeroplane as a whole.</p>

<p>Aeroplane construction consists almost exclusively of a
framework of wood braced by wires, a condition of things
which has obtained since the inception of flight; as may be
judged by the various engravings of Henson’s projected monoplane
of 1842. This machine incorporated an arrangement
of king-posts and wires approximating very closely to modern
practice, and the natural sequence of improvements have
tended towards the gradual elimination of exposed wiring.</p>

<h3>Various Wires used.</h3>

<p>The various wires used in construction may be classified
into four distinct types: the solid wire stay, the straining cord
or cable used for stay wires, the extra flexible cable used for
controls, and the swaged tie rods in plain or streamline form.
The earliest form of bracing was of the solid piano wire variety,
this having been used on most aeroplanes from the days of the
Wrights onward. From the view-point of the early pioneers,
this wire was eminently satisfactory, being cheap (a vital consideration)
and simple to attach and replace. Although the
tensile strength of this wire cannot probably be excelled, its
hardness renders somewhat difficult the forming of the end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
loop without fracture of the wire. For this reason piano wire
gradually gave place to a softer grade of wire which, while
being strong, was tough and ductile, enabling bends to be
made with a lesser danger of fracture. The original connection
used for the piano wire stay is shown by <a href="#i_fig103">Fig. 103</a>, this
consisting of a loop or eye, the free end being turned round a
ferrule of soft copper tube, this being sometimes varied by the
use of a flat strip of tinned iron, wrapped round and soldered.
While this was fairly satisfactory for short stays, it was hardly
suitable for the main lift wires of the interplane bracing,
owing to the comparative ease with which, under load, the
free end pulled or cut through the ferrule, so that after a
while the oval spring-wire ferrule, <a href="#i_fig104">Fig. 104</a>, came into use.
This is made of the same gauge wire as the stay, and is from
seven to nine convolutions in length. The eye should be
formed as an easy bend, and not kinked, the ferrule being
pushed tight against the shoulders, and the free end turned
back.</p>

<h3>Result of Tests.</h3>

<p>Tests undertaken at the instance of the American Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics showed that 80 per cent. of the
wires tested failed by the free end pulling through the ferrule,
the remaining 20 per cent. failing by fracture, the stays
possessing an average efficiency of 68 per cent. of the
maximum strength of the wire. Although various modifications,
such as tying the free end to the ferrule with fine wire,
as in <a href="#i_fig105">Fig. 105</a>, resulted in an increase in total efficiency,
average European practice consists of that shown by <a href="#i_fig104">Fig. 104</a>.
At the present time the solid wire stay of the form dealt with
is used mainly for the bracing of the fuselage frame, and the
internal wiring of the tail planes.</p>

<h3>Stranded Cable.</h3>

<p>The gradual increase in engine power and total weight of
aeroplanes led to the adoption of stranded cable for all important
loaded wires, this being made in two distinct ways.</p>

<p>The cable employed for interplane bracing is composed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
a number of fine wires, varying from nineteen to thirty-seven
according to the different diameters, the end section being
indicated by <a href="#i_fig106">Fig. 106</a>.</p>

<span id="i_fig104"></span><span id="i_fig105"></span><span id="i_fig106"></span><span id="i_fig107"></span>
<span id="i_fig108"></span><span id="i_fig109"></span><span id="i_fig110"></span><span id="i_fig111"></span>
<span id="i_fig112"></span>
<figure id="i_fig103" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig103.png" width="1884" height="1465" style="width: 30em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 103–112.</span>—Methods of forming wire connections.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Where extra flexibility is required, such as for control
wires running round pulleys, the cable is composed of a
number of strands, generally seven, which in turn consists of
a number of fine wires, usually nineteen, the end section being
shown by <a href="#i_fig107">Fig. 107</a>. English practice designates this form of
cable as extra flexible, and the single rope of nineteen wires
as straining cord. American classification is practically the
reverse, in that the single rope is known as stranded cable,
and the multi-strand as cord. Although the factor of strength
is an important one it does not entirely govern the selection of
a wire, as other considerations, such as flexibility and fatigue
strain, influence greatly the efficiency of a stay under active
service conditions. Under test the solid wire possesses the
greatest ultimate breaking weight, the next best being the
single rope. It must be understood that in flight a wire is
subjected to constant and intensive vibration, which must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
have a deleterious effect on the material, and for this reason
a flaw or slight fracture in a solid wire may escape notice
until complete failure in the air; whereas the cable, by the
unstranding of the damaged wires, would give warning of
wear. Chiefly owing to the difficulty of forming a satisfactory
splice in the single-strand cable, modern practice inclines
toward the use of the multi-strand cable for all purposes, as
the construction of this wire lends itself to the forming of a
successful splice.</p>

<h3>Cable Connections.</h3>

<p>The earliest form of terminal connection for stranded cable
consisted of a loop, the free end being bound to the main part
of the wire and soldered. With the addition of a binding or
serving of wire round the loop to prevent injury, due to
contact with the wiring lug, or strainer eye, this wire, in a
recent test, gave an efficiency of 100 per cent. for all diameters
up to ¼ in.</p>

<p>This result, considering the elementary nature of the joint,
is surprising. Unfortunately the effect of corrosion due to acid
and solder is a somewhat doubtful quantity; moreover, the
appearance of the joint is far from neat. An attachment
which at one time achieved some popularity is shown by
<a href="#i_fig108">Fig. 108</a>, and is especially suitable for the single-strand wire.
This consists of a cone-shaped forked end with a taper hole,
into which the cable is inserted, the free end being unstranded,
spread out and soldered. The attachment has been used on
what was at one time one of our best products. The efficiency
obtained with this fitting is in the neighbourhood of 100 per
cent.</p>

<p>In the method indicated by <a href="#i_fig109">Fig. 109</a> a piece of flat copper
tube is passed over the wire, the free end of the latter being
bent round a brass thimble, and then passed through the
copper tube, in a similar manner to the connection for the
solid wire in <a href="#i_fig102">Fig. 102</a>. The tube is then given several turns,
and the complete joint well soldered. This system is reliable,
and has given good results.</p>

<p>A distinctive terminal is indicated by <a href="#i_fig110">Fig. 110</a>, consisting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
of a brass ferrule just sufficiently wide to accommodate the
two thicknesses of wire. The bolts are of the counter-sunk
head variety, so that the operation of screwing a bolt home
also forces the wires into the protuberances in the sides of the
ferrule. Although the foregoing methods have all been extensively
used, they have now given place to the thimble
splice, <a href="#i_fig111">Fig. 111</a>, which, as a general proposition, is undoubtedly
the better terminal connection. The brass thimble protects
the strands from the wearing effect produced by contact with the
turnbuckle or wiring lug. It is the usual practice to wrap
the splice with a binding or serving of fine copper wire, or
waxed twine. The efficiency of this joint with a properly
made splice may be safely taken as 85 per cent. of the total
strength of the wire. With this joint the point of failure, as
evidenced by numerous tests, always occurs at, or near, the
last tuck in the splice, at which point the extra thickness of
the splice is just merging into the normal thickness of the
wire. The disadvantage with all terminal connections which
necessitate the use of solder is the impossibility of determining
just how much the heating operation affects the
strength of the wire, and also the effects of corrosion, set up
by the various species of flux used in the process of soldering.</p>

<h3>Relative Strengths.</h3>

<p>For a given diameter the solid-wire stay possesses the
greatest strength, the next best being the single-stranded
cable, as the following comparison of stay strength, taken
from the Report of the National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics, 1915, of America, will <span class="locked">show:—</span></p>

<h3>Streamline Wires.</h3>

<p>Although in the quest for increased speed the number of
exposed wires were reduced to a minimum, the aggregate
resistance still remained considerable, this leading to the
development of the swaged streamline wire, the introduction
of which is generally ascribed to the Royal Aircraft Factory;
and these wires are now generally used for all exposed wiring.
The points in favour of them are that, properly fitted, a
considerable reduction in resistance is obtained, there is a
lessened liability to slacken after some use, this rendering
rigging a more certain operation, and the nature of its connection
obviates the use of turnbuckles.</p>

<span id="i_fig114"></span><span id="i_fig115"></span><span id="i_fig116"></span>
<figure id="i_fig113" class="figcenter">

  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 113–116.</span>—Methods of forming wire connections.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>They have been variously criticized as being expensive to
produce, that the resistance may be increased if improperly
aligned in the machine, and also that any fracture or flaw is
less liable to be detected before complete failure during flight.
In manufacture the solid rod is rolled to the section shown by
<a href="#i_fig112">Fig. 112</a>, a certain length each end being left for the right- and
left-hand thread. Two of the connections mostly used
are shown by <a href="#i_fig113">Figs. 113</a> and <a href="#i_fig114">114</a>, the latter being preferable,
as the universal joint permits of movement in two directions,
which reduces the tendency of the wire to crystallize as a
result of excessive vibration. To prevent wear at the points
of intersection it is usual to fit acorns of fibre or aluminium, a
popular form being shown by <a href="#i_fig115">Fig. 115</a>. Some designers still
prefer to use the wire cable for interplane bracing, a fairing of
wood being bound to the cables by tape at intervals, this also
preventing excessive vibration.</p>

<p>Some years ago various attempts were made, mostly on
French monoplanes, to utilize flat steel ribbon for exposed
wiring, but, owing to the difficulty of successfully forming a
terminal, its use never became extensive, although it may
possibly be regarded as the precursor of the modern streamline
wire.</p>

<p>It is notable that, so far, the wiring of all German aeroplanes
is effected by cable, so that apparently the merits of
the streamline wire are not recognized. It is also surprising
that no attempt has been made to streamline the cable. A
device for tying the wires and preventing friction at the point
of intersection, found on nearly all enemy aeroplanes, is indicated
by <a href="#i_fig116">Fig. 116</a>, and there are also instances of quick release
devices, these being popular in this country about 1912, and
now obsolete.</p>

<p>Although determined attempts have been made of late to
entirely eliminate exposed wiring, examples of this occurring
in the recent German Fokker triplane, it appears that the
various alterations engendered by this procedure in the
structure of the machine more than counteract the saving in
head resistance.</p>

<p>Moreover, with modern methods of construction the ultimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
strength of a wireless wing structure leaves considerable
room for improvement, and the price paid for the saving is
too great.</p>

<p>The arrival of the all-steel aeroplane would entirely alter
the condition of things, as with this construction much better
chances exist for the production of a reasonably strong wing
structure without exposed wing bracing.</p>

<span class="subhead">ENGINE MOUNTINGS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> mounting of the engine and the general arrangement
constitute one of the most important and interesting sections
of aeroplane construction, and perhaps a brief outline of the
various engines in use will suitably preface a consideration of
the mountings of the different types. Although there are
signs that certain revolutionary engines may eventually come
into use, the types in use on modern aircraft are the stationary
air and water-cooled, the radial air and water-cooled, and the
air-cooled rotary. The greater variety occurs with the stationary
type of engine, which may be sub-divided into those
in which the cylinders are arranged vertically in line, and
those where the cylinders viewed from the front form a <b class="sans">V</b>.
Engines typical of the former class are the Beardmore,
Green, Mercedes, and Benz, all of which are water-cooled; and
of the latter class, Rolls-Royce, Sunbeam, Hispano-Suiza
water-cooled, and the Renault and R.A.F. air-cooled. The
types of radial engines which have been extensively used are
confined to two, these being the air-cooled Anzani and the
water-cooled Salmson. There is another radial engine of
comparatively recent production; but mention of this while
present conditions obtain is not permissible. Rotary engines
of note are the Gnome, Le Rhone, and Clerget, all of which
are necessarily air-cooled.</p>

<h3>Essential Requirements of an Engine Mounting.</h3>

<p>The essential features of any mounting are absolute
rigidity, accessibility to permit ease of erection and dismounting;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
and it should also be of a moderately low weight. Moreover,
the general arrangement must offer a minimum of head
resistance, although in this direction the type of engine used
is a determining factor. Rigidity is a paramount consideration,
for the slightest tendency to slackness or “play,” under
the effect of engine vibration, speedily develops, until either
serious stresses are induced in the fore part of the fuselage or
the engine loses its correct alignment, with a consequent
detrimental effect on the flying qualities of the aeroplane.
This, of course, should be provided against in the general
design; but it is also a contingency which should be kept in
mind during the actual construction of the various components
of the complete mounting.</p>

<p>A detail which does not always receive sufficient attention
is the provision of adequate bracing against the thrust of the
engine. Where the construction is such that the engine-bearers
form an integral part of the fuselage structure, there
is generally little fault to find, but with some sheet steel
mountings, particularly those employed for the rotary type of
engine, the only bracing in a fore-and-aft direction is that
provided by the flanged edges of the plate, which are usually
much too narrow to be of real use. Further, the construction
of both the engine mounting and the fore part of the fuselage
should be of the necessary strength to ensure that the bearers
supporting the engine are always correctly in alignment and
dead level. With some methods of construction the weight
of the engine and various landing shocks, result after a time
in the lowering of the bearers at the front, which means that
the angle of thrust is not in its correct position relative to the
centre of gravity and the incidence of the wings, this being
extremely detrimental to the flying properties of the machine.</p>

<h3>Materials.</h3>

<p>Wood, on account of its property of absorbing vibration,
is particularly well suited for the construction of the engine
mounting, and one finds examples of its use in a variety of
ways. Perhaps the most common form is that in which a
bearer of ash or spruce, channelled out between the fastening-down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
bolt holes for lightness, is attached to steel brackets
which in turn are bolted to the various fuselage members. A
development of this method consists of mounting the bearers
on either multi-ply formers of wood, or built-up wood brackets
stiffened with a three-ply covering on each side, and both of
these arrangements are being extensively used. Sheet steel
is used for the mountings of various machines, but it does not
possess the characteristic of absorbing vibration. In some
instances one finds that the engine has been specifically
designed to be supported on bearers of the tubular variety,
in either steel or duralumin; but here again rigidity is difficult
of attainment. Although the use of welding, that is to any
extent, is not advisable in the construction of the engine
mounting, one finds this process very extensively used for the
mountings of some modern machines. In one particular
instance, the tubular bearers are supported from the steel tube
fuselage by various tubes, the whole structure being welded,
and although every joint successfully survived a smash which
resulted in a considerable bending and distortion of the fuselage,
its use does not engender a sense of security or reliability.</p>

<h3>Rotary Engine Mountings.</h3>

<figure id="i_fig117" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig117.png" width="1108" height="719" style="width: 18em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 117.</span>—Rotary engine mounting, in which engine is supported
between two plates.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The mountings associated with the rotary type of engine
fall under two categories: those where the motor is supported
between two or more plates, and those in which the motor
itself is overhung. The method of mounting adopted for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
first case is generally the type shown by <a href="#i_fig117">Fig. 117</a>. The plates
are pressed or bent up from sheet steel, and all edges flanged
to prevent buckling. The front plate embodies a ball race,
through which the propeller shaft runs, while to the rear
bearer is bolted the back plate of the engine. This arrangement
with minor variations has been extensively used for the
different makes of small scouting biplanes engined with the
80 h.p. and 100 h.p. Gnome motors.</p>

<p>Where the weight of the rotary engine used is excessive, as
in the case of the 160 h.p. Gnome with 20 cylinders, which is
now out of date, a mounting incorporating three bearers is
used. The arrangement would be similar to that indicated
by <a href="#i_fig117">Fig. 117</a>, with the addition of an extra bearer for the
support of the crank-shaft extension.</p>

<h3>Overhung Mounting.</h3>

<figure id="i_fig118" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig118.png" width="1116" height="789" style="width: 18em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 118.</span>—Overhung rotary engine mounting.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The overhung type of engine mounting which is used for
both propeller and tractor aeroplanes, is shown by <a href="#i_fig118">Fig. 118</a>.
In this case the back plate of the motor is bolted to the capping
plate, while an extension of the hollow crank shaft is supported
by a smaller rear plate. This system has been very widely
used, chiefly by reason of its extreme lightness, and the great
facility afforded for the operation of dismounting the engine;
indeed, it would be difficult to find an arrangement in which
the demands of accessibility are so well satisfied. Another
form of overhung mounting, which has been used for a radial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
Anzani motor, is shown by <a href="#i_fig119">Fig. 119</a>. In this case the four
longerons of the fuselage are capped by a single flanged steel
plate, to which the engine is attached by long bolts through
the crank case. Additional support is provided by light steel
tube stays, which are taken from various points on the front
of the crank case to the centre section of the upper plane, or
other parts of the machine.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Fig. 120.</span>—An overhung mounting built up of steel tubes.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A distinctly original type of overhung mounting is shown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
by <a href="#i_fig120">Fig. 120</a> in front and side elevation, this being used on a
machine incorporating an all-steel fuselage. The ring to
which the back plate of the engine is bolted, is supported from
the four corners of the fuselage by steel tubing, while the
bearing for the crank-shaft extension is formed by a pyramid
of tubes welded to a pressing of sheet steel, to which in turn
is bolted a ball-race housing. At each corner the three converging
tubes are welded together, and bolted to small angle
plates, which are also welded to the framework of the fuselage.
It will be seen that the strength of this mounting is entirely
dependent upon the welding; but such reliance, in view of the
generally uncertain nature of this latter process, is not to be
recommended.</p>

<h3>A Stationary Engine Mounting.</h3>

<figure id="i_fig121" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig121.png" width="1106" height="810" style="width: 18em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 121.</span>—Stationary engine mounting.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A mounting used for a 70 h.p. air-cooled Renault, which
is designed to be supported by short lengths of steel tube
projecting from the crank case, is shown by <a href="#i_fig121">Fig. 121</a>, this
particular arrangement being used on a propeller biplane.
The four ash longerons of the nacelle are built up in the form
of a box girder, the struts immediately under the engine
bearers being reinforced with steel plates. The steel tubes
from the crank case embedded in a steel bearing, composed
of two semi-circular clips, which are let into the upper longerons,
and are prevented from moving sideways by steel collars
sweated to the tubes and abutting against the fixing clips.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
In this case, by the removal of the four fixing clips and the
necessary pipe connections, the engine can be lifted bodily out.</p>

<h3>Multi-Engine Mountings.</h3>

<p>Several versions of the type of machine employing two or
more engines, and which, by the way, is regarded as being the
type most suitable for the commercial purposes of the future,
are existent. The usual arrangement with the twin-engined
machine is to support the engines between the planes on
either side of the body, the bearers being mounted on a
structure of struts, which also serve as interplane supports.</p>

<p>With regard to the flying-boat type of machine, a favourite
practice is to mount the motor on the four struts supporting
the centre section of the upper plane, which is braced by
struts and wires from different points on the hull or body.</p>

<p>Although the modern aircraft engine is of greatly increased
power, compared with the engine of the period 1912–1914, one
does not find any great difference in the structural features
of the mounting employed, and in view of the very diverse
arrangements for mounting the same type of engine which
now exist, there is need for greater uniformity. With regard
to the materials employed, there is a very pronounced trend
towards the greater use of wood, which circumstance is
certainly at variance with the oft-portended approaching era
of steel. As indicated in previous chapters, wood possesses
remarkable powers of resistance to sudden shock, which, combined
with its quality of absorbing vibration, renders it
peculiarly suitable for the structure of the aeroplane, and
despite its numerous defects, will undoubtedly continue in
use until either the available supplies of suitable timber are
exhausted, or until the production of a remarkably light alloy
possessing high strength values.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV"><span id="toclink_123"></span>CHAPTER XV.<br>

<span class="subhead">ERECTION AND ALIGNMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> accurate erection and alignment or truing up of the aeroplane,
is a cogent factor in ensuring that the best performance
is obtained, and it is almost platitudinous to emphasize the
fact that a machine incorrectly aligned gives inferior results
in flight, entails greater attention on the part of the pilot, and
may possibly seriously interfere with the general stability of
the aeroplane. The degree of precision attained in the manufacture
of the various components is reflected in the ease or
otherwise with which the complete assembly is aligned; indeed,
accuracy of erection is impossible without the close observance
of limits and general trueness in the production of the different
parts. For this reason the erection of the principal components
is surveyed as a necessary preliminary to a consideration
of their assembly in the complete structure.</p>

<h3>Accurate Part Production.</h3>

<p>In the production of the various struts, longerons and
fittings of the fuselage, the wing spars, compression and interplane
struts of the planes, the utmost accuracy must be
observed. Although tolerances are permissible with regard to
the overall dimensions of the struts, spars, longerons, etc., the
lengths particularly of the fuselage struts should be absolutely
correct to drawing. The bad effects of a strut, say 1 millimetre
short, are not restricted to the particular component of which
it forms a part, but are noticeable in one way or another in
the complete structure. Similarly the ends of struts which
are required to be square should be dead square, and those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
which are cut to a bevel should correspond with the correct
angle. The result of the slightest discrepancy in this respect
becomes speedily apparent when the defective struts are
assembled, as the tension of the bracing wires will result in
the strut becoming bowed or bent, this being due to the
bedding down of the strut end in the socket or clip. It is
also advisable to trim the ends in a machine after being sawn
to something approaching the correct length, and the practice
of sawing to dead length should not be permitted. The
surface of a sawn strut end is formed of a number of more
or less ragged fibres, which in position in the machine and
under pressure of the bracing wires tend to gradually flatten
down, this resulting in slack wires and loss of alignment.
Absolute accuracy and uniformity of part production can only
be obtained by the use of jigs, preferably of metal, and some
form of jig should certainly be used for cutting the various
struts to length. Referring again to the necessity of the strut
ends being of the correct angle, it is surprising to note the
effect of the smallest inaccuracy. The writer has frequently
noticed fuselage struts considerably out of straight, the grain
of the timber being sometimes advanced as the reason. However,
the removal of the defective strut always resulted in its
return to a straight condition. It should be realized that the
effect of an initially bent strut is a reduction of strength, and
as this may prove a source of danger, it is in itself sufficient
reason for the rigid observance of length limits.</p>

<h3>Drilling of Bolt Holes.</h3>

<p>Of equal importance is the drilling of the various bolt holes
for the attachment of the fittings. It is not always advisable
to drill the holes in the spars and longerons before the fittings
are applied, but in numerous instances this is possible, and
where interchangeability is an important consideration it is
imperative. The practice of setting out the positions of the
various holes from a drawing and then drilling with a hand
brace, is a procedure only justified when a small number of
machines of a certain type are to be produced, and ought by
now to be obsolete. Under such a system no two spars would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
be exactly the same, as owing to the influence of grain in the
wood, the drill or bit always tends to “run” from the correct
angle. Viewed from the aspect of quantity production such a
practice is very deficient. It is only by the use of metal
drilling jigs of suitable design that anything approaching
absolute accuracy is possible. Such jigs should not only locate
the hole, but should also form a guide for the drill. In the
attachment of the fittings to a properly jig-drilled spar, it
should not be necessary to again drill through, although this
often occurs. Where this is done, there is a distinct possibility
of the brace not being held true, which means that the
hole becomes larger than necessary and not infrequently oval
in shape. An additional bad point is the impossibility of
detecting such a fault after the fitting is bolted on, and it may
not be realized until a noticeably slack wire in the complete
machine indicates the movement of the fitting. In the foregoing,
absolute accuracy in the various fittings has been
assumed, but unfortunately in practice almost the reverse is
true. Variation generally occurs in built- or bent-up fittings,
and is usually the result of jigs of either incorrect or bad
design. Where the variation includes a hole out of position,
the use of this fitting on a previously drilled wood part is only
possible by the bad practice of drilling through with the
results explained above. It will thus be realized that the
uniformity and accuracy of component production is only
attainable by the utmost precision in the manufacture of both
wood and metal parts.</p>

<h3>Locking of Bolts.</h3>

<p>Throughout the complete machine it is necessary to lock
the nuts of the bolts, to prevent their gradual loosening under
the vibration of the engine, and different methods of accomplishing
this are in use. Undoubtedly the best form of lock is
by the use of a castellated nut and split pin. By this method
one can readily ascertain whether or no a bolt is locked, while
by the withdrawal of the split pin the bolt may be taken out.
A disadvantage is that its use entails considerable drilling, so
that a modification consists of fitting castellated nuts to all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
bolts liable to removal for minor adjustments; while elsewhere
the threaded portion of the bolt is left a little longer than the
nut, and then riveted over. Although this reduces labour, it
is a somewhat destructive method; and it is also difficult to
determine the adequacy of the riveting. Another method
consists of filing the bolt end flush with the nut, and then
centre punching three or four dots in the joint between nut
and bolt.</p>

<p>This method is neat, the removal of a bolt is easily
effected, and the fact that it has been used in the construction
of some fast scouting biplanes is proof of its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Other systems include the use of two nuts, of a single nut
soldered to the bolt end, and the various patent lock-washers,
which in this country are not greatly in vogue. The practice
of re-running down the threads of bolts to ensure ease in the
application of the nut is not to be recommended—that is,
indiscriminately done. Unless the die is properly adjusted
there is a possibility of too much thread being taken off; the
result, an extremely slack nut, being detrimental to general
reliability. The durability of an aeroplane in service is
dependent upon the good workmanship effected in the smallest
and most insignificant detail. Moreover, it should be remembered
that the absence of a split pin may eventually result in
disaster.</p>

<h3>Truing of Main Planes.</h3>

<p>The planes or sections of a machine of the straight-wing
type, as distinct from a machine possessing arrow-shaped or
retreating wings, should, when erected on the fuselage, form a
straight line from tip to tip. This feature is dependent upon
(1) the trueness of the planes, and (2) the alignment of the
attachments on the fuselage, the latter being considered under
the fuselage heading. To ensure that the plane is quite
square, it should be checked previous to covering by diagonal
measurements on the wing spars, these being taken from
accurate set positions such as are provided by the wing-root
attachments and the interplane strut fittings. Should a difference
in the diagonals exist, this can easily be rectified by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
slight adjustment of the turnbuckles incorporated in the
internal plane wiring. As the ribs of the plane are built up
beforehand, and checked for correct contour by pattern, little
variation should occur in the camber. A point where differences
may occur is between the front spar and the leading
edge, as the nose formers are generally inserted during the
assembling of the plane. For the detection of faults in this
direction the template illustrated by <a href="#i_fig34">Fig. 34</a> in Chapter IV. is
of great utility.</p>

<h3>Fabric Covering of Planes.</h3>

<p>The evenness and correct tautness of the fabric covering
contributes largely to the trueness of the plane. Should the
covering be stretched unevenly or too tightly, the application
of the dope will cause distortion of the framework, which can
only be obviated by re-covering. The bad effects of this is
more noticeable with regard to the ailerons, elevators and
rudder, which, being of very slender construction, are more
liable to deformation. Twisted or warped control surfaces
should never be used, as such surfaces not only offer increased
resistance, but also interfere with the balance of the machine
in flight.</p>

<h3>Fuselage Erection.</h3>

<p>As the fuselage constitutes the nucleus of the aeroplane,
accuracy of alignment in this component is essential, and the
degree of accuracy obtained in the complete erection depends
largely on the correctness or otherwise of the fuselage. In
different individual designs the methods employed for the
construction of the body will be found to vary considerably.
The process of erection adopted in many instances is to
assemble the sides first, upon a table or bench upon which the
correct disposition of the various parts have previously been
set out. The wires are adjusted until the sides conform to the
setting out, which are then packed up on a pair of trestles and
the cross-struts attached. It now remains to align the body
so that it is perfectly symmetrical in plan; and this is accomplished
by marking the centre of each cross-strut, preferably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
before insertion in the fuselage, and then adjusting the plan-wires
until a cord stretched from the stern-post to the nose
covers each centre line. The cross or sectional bracing-wires
are then tensioned until each diagonal coincides absolutely in
length. This procedure answers very well for a small fuselage
of simple construction, and of the wire-braced fabric-covered
type; but where the forward portion is covered with ply-wood,
and the top rails of the body are horizontal, viewed in side
elevation, it is usual to true up on a bench. This consists of
a wooden structure built up of strong sides, with legs at short
intervals, the whole being well braced. The top surface, on
which the body lays, is composed of boards placed wherever a
plan-strut occurs. The bench should be rigidly fixed to a
concrete floor, the top planed until it is level both longitudinally
and transversely, and a centre line marked on each
board, while these lines, checked with a fine steel wire stretched
from end to end, should be in exact agreement with it. The
fuselage, having been previously assembled, with the wires
inserted and the plan struts accurately centred, is placed on it
in an inverted position. All wires should be then slacked off,
and the top, which is now underneath, should be wired until
the centre on each strut coincides with the centres on the
bench. The side wires are then tensioned until the stern post
is vertical, or until various fixed points, such as wing-spar
attachments, are in agreement with points marked on the
bench and squared or lined up, and also until the longerons
are touching every board. The sectional wires are then
tightened and adjusted so that each diagonal is of the same
length; and this will ensure the centre lines on the cross-struts
connecting the bottom rails being plumb or vertical
over the centre lines of the cross-struts connecting the top
rails. Where the top rails of the fuselage are not parallel to
the line of flight, but slope down towards the tail, it would be
necessary, if the bench method is used, to construct it so that
the boards conform to the slope. With the wire-braced fuselage
minor adjustments to the wing-spar attachments, which
predetermine the angle of incidence of the main planes, can
be subsequently made. A type of fuselage which precludes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
this operation, and which demands extreme accuracy in construction,
is that in which the bracing of the forward portion
is effected by three-ply, all wiring in a vertical dimension
being eliminated, this system being described in <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">Chapter VIII</a>.
and illustrated by <a href="#i_fig66">Fig. 66</a>.</p>

<p>With this construction points such as the wing spar attachments
are fixed, and cannot be altered after the fuselage is
built, so that meticulous care must be taken in the setting of
the short wing spars across the body, or the fittings to which
the wing roots are anchored.</p>

<p>Where a joint occurs in the fuselage it is usual to build
the tail separate from the front portion, and occasionally the
two sections are trued up independently. This does not give
such good results as when the two portions, although separately
built, are joined together and trued up complete.</p>

<h3>Checking of Fuselage.</h3>

<p>To check the fuselage for alignment it should be placed on
a pair of trestles, one underneath the forward undercarriage
strut fixing and the other under a vertical strut a short
distance from the stern post. The body should then be
levelled up longitudinally by a straightedge placed on two short
straightedges of exactly similar widths, one being placed at
the front and the other towards the tail. It should then be
packed up on the trestles until the top longerons are dead
level across. At this point, if the body is in correct alignment,
the engine-bearers would be level both longitudinally
and transversely, the incidence of the main spar attachments
should be correct and the stern post perfectly vertical in all
directions. Other tests should include the placing of a straightedge
at the nose, and another placed at the points where struts
occur, should, when sighted across the top edges, be “out of
wind,” that is in agreement. A point which should be carefully
levelled is that portion of the fuselage towards the stern
post to which is attached the fixed tail plane. Any inaccuracy
here will result in the tail being twisted in relation to the
main planes. Each fitting or attachment should also be equidistant
from the stern post, and the effect of variation here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
will be evidenced by the tail plane being out of square with
the centre line of the fuselage. Where the type of machine is
such that the engine is supported on bearers of wood, it is usual
to drill the holes for the accommodation of the holding-down
bolts to jig before the bearer is built in the structure. In this
case care should be taken to ensure that the corresponding
bolt holes in each bearer are square with the centre line. Any
deviation will result in the axis of the engine forming an angle
with the centre line.</p>

<h3>Alignment of Complete Machine.</h3>

<p>In this connection it will be better to consider the alignment
of a type of machine in common use: a tractor-biplane
in which the upper plane is composed of two outer planes
and a centre section, and the lower plane in two sections, each
abutting against the side of the fuselage, this arrangement
being shown in front elevation by <a href="#i_fig122">Fig. 122</a>. The first operation
is the levelling of the fuselage transversely by placing the
level across the engine bearers, and the attachment of the
centre section, which is mounted upon four struts which have
been previously cut to dead length and tested by jig. This,
considered in front elevation, should be centrally placed over
the body, and this is assured by adjustments in the wires
A-A1. This can be checked by dropping a plumb-line from
the centre plane spar ends and measuring the distance from
the line to the side of the body, the distances on either side
should, of course, coincide. The next point is to brace the
outer sections to the correct dihedral. One method of accomplishing
this, as shown by <a href="#i_fig122">Fig. 122</a>, is by the use of a dihedral
board, this being prepared perfectly straight on one edge, the
other being tapered to the desired angle. The wires are then
adjusted until the straightedge is level. Another method is
to use an ordinary straightedge placed along the top surface of
the plane, the angle being measured with a protractor or
clinometer, the latter instrument being most accurate. To
check the dihedral a line can be stretched between points
immediately above the top interplane struts on each side and
then measuring to the centre section, but it would be difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
to detect differences in the angles of each wing. With regard
to the undercarriage, the distances between lines dropped from
the fuselage sides and the wheel centres should coincide.</p>

<h3>Alignment of Machine in Side Elevation.</h3>

<p>Considering the side elevation, <a href="#i_fig123">Fig. 123</a>, alignment here is
concerned with the incidence of the main planes, the distance
forward of the top plane from the lower plane or stagger, and
the level of the engine bearers in relation to the top longerons
of the fuselage.</p>

<span id="i_fig123"></span><span id="i_fig124"></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 124.</span>—Template for checking incidence.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The fuselage should be levelled longitudinally by placing
the level on the engine bearers, assuming the engine is not in
place. When the bearers are level, the top longeron should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
also be level, in any case the incidence of the plane should
only be adjusted in relation to the engine bearers. To check
the stagger, a plumb line should be dropped from the leading
edge of the centre plane, and adjustments made with the
incidence wires from the fuselage to the centre-plane struts,
until the required distance forward from the leading edge of
the lower plane is obtained. The incidence can be tested by
a straightedge placed under the plane and a clinometer, as in
<a href="#i_fig123">Fig. 123</a>, and another device sometimes used is shown by
<a href="#i_fig124">Fig. 124</a>. This is made of dry wood, the lengths of the legs
to the tops of the spars being obtained from a drawing of the
wing section, and its incidence.</p>

<h3>Plan Alignment of Machine.</h3>

<figure id="i_fig125" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig125.png" width="2392" height="1871" style="width: 38em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 125.</span>—Showing points to check for correct alignment on plan.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the plan view, <a href="#i_fig125">Fig. 125</a>, the distances AB and AC must
be equal, the same applying to CD and BD. With modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
machines external drift wiring is obsolete, so that discrepancies
in these measurements must be rectified by alterations
in the wiring of the fuselage, as it is inaccuracy at some point
in the latter component to which the trouble may be ascribed.
It is at this point that one realizes the need for precision in
the construction of the fuselage. In <a href="#i_fig126">Fig. 126</a> is shown a plan
view in which the main plane is very obviously out of square
with the centre line of the body, the amount is not likely to
occur in actual practice, but it has been exaggerated in the
drawing. The cause of this trouble can be traced to the short
wing spars in the fuselage, to which the lower plane is
attached, or in other cases to the fittings, to which the lower
plane is anchored, being out of centre, possibly only an insignificant
amount. The lengths of the fuselage wing spars are
also possible causes of trouble. Assuming that the rear spar is
the correct length, and the front spar is over the length, this
would result, when the outer sections were attached, in the
latter sloping backwards, which again emphasizes the need for
accurate part production.</p>

<figure id="i_fig126" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_fig126.png" width="1172" height="939" style="width: 19em;" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 126.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With regard to the tail plane, measurements taken from
the extremities of the back spar to some fixed point forward
on the fuselage, to the strut sockets on the planes, or to the
rear wing spar anchorage, as in <a href="#i_fig125">Fig. 125</a>, should be equal.</p>

<p>The primary consideration with regard to the rudder and
fin is that, viewed from the rear, they should be perpendicular,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
which can be verified by a plumb-line dropped from the top of
the rudder-post. In plan view the fixed fin should correspond
with the centre line of the fuselage although there are exceptions
to this rule, notably where the fin is set over, to
neutralize propeller torque, and in this case the measurements
given in the general drawings must be adhered to.</p>

<h3>Tension of Wires.</h3>

<p>The correct tensioning of wires is a matter upon which
some variation of opinion occurs. Although wires should not
be left slack, conversely they should not be over-tensioned, as
this results in the spars, wires, and struts, being initially
stressed before any load due to flight is applied. In this connection
the importance of even or uniform tension in the
wires may be emphasized. The wires in one bay being of
greater tension than those in an adjacent bay, is the frequent
cause of bent or deformed struts. The more extended use of
a tautness meter for the interplane wiring would result in
greater uniformity and the more equal distribution of stresses.</p>

by noting some characteristic detail, such as the radiator, the
trade mark, the hubs, etc., so can the main types of aeroplanes

outstanding features of each machine. It must be admitted,
nevertheless, that it needs considerable experience to be able
definitely to classify detail modifications of a particular type of
aircraft, for the difference is often very slight. Besides, the
machines are frequently only visible at a great distance, and for
but short periods (their speed being so high—60 to 150 miles per
hour). There are, moreover, physical difficulties to contend with,
in the form of clouds, effects of winds, position of the sun, etc.</p>

identify any aircraft, provided it can be seen for sufficient time to
